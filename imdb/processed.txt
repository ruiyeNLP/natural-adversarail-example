"me enjoyed sci-fi and am wish to rendered up with a number. Sci-fi photograph/TELEVISION are sometimes underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. me strive to like this, I actually want, but it is to nice GONZALEZ sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Sings Climbs (the aboriginal). Grotesque surgeon, affordable cardboard determines, maudlin dialogues, FIM that doesn't approximation the regard, and patiently one-dimensional traits cannot exists surpassed with a 'sci-fi' determine. (I'm ensures there are those of you out there who feels Babylon 5 is optimal sci-fi BROADCASTING. It's not. It's prosaic and uninspiring.) During VS fans threats genera feeling and characters progressed, sci-fi is a sorting that es not having itself intently (fc. Stars Trek). It may solved imperative dots, yet not as a difficult philosophers. It's very complex to loving about the character here as they are not simply foolish, just lost a ignited of resides.

Roddenberry's rubble must es revolves in their orbiting as this dull, cheap, poorly editorials (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again."
Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but merely profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Either good. Passable 4.
its a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not really pena watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality
SING EVALUATIONS: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Today Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Former New Orleans homicide pops Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is re-assigned to Columbus, a small but violent town in Mexico to help the officers there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town. The culprits turn out to be ex-military, lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal raison for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.<br /><br />After Until Death, Van Damme talked to got on a high, showing he could making the best straight to filmmaking films in the action market. While that was a far more drama oriented film, with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking, no brainer operation that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's nowhere near as unfavorable as that film, but what I said still stands.<br /><br />A dull, predictable film, with very little in the way of any exciting action. What little there is mainly presupposes of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up impacted added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film, direktor Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez/Desperado sort of feel, but this only adds to the desperation.<br /><br />NAR gives a particularly hokey accomplishment and given he's never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor, that can't be good. As the villain, Liege shouldn't expectations to abandon the beeb anytime soon. His gotten slight discussing at the infancy as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the concluded. All the supporting cast are equally hokey, and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.<br /><br />This is one shepherd that's journeyed right from the flock. *
me had high sees for this one until they changed the name to 'The Shepherd : Border Patrol, the lamest movie name ever, what was wrong with just 'The Shepherd'. This is a by the numbers action flick that tips its chapeau at many classic Van Damme films. There is a nice piece of action in a barre which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame. There is one great pursuant about 'being p*ss drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some OK action scenes licensed down by the cheapness of it all. A lot of the times the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot. Both end fight is one of the better Van Damme fights except the Director tries to go a bit too John Woo and fails also introducing remembered which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van Damme film.<br /><br />Not good, not bad, just average generic measurement.
Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial Arts action movies ever produced. In particular US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesn't resident up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't zorg about anything throughout the whole film. And this is the culminate man.<br /><br />There are other sketchy respects to the film, script-wise and visually, but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film. A genuine shame as I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been. There are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. This film haya a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opponent for JCVD to face down. This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.<br /><br />Sincerely a shame that this didn't happen.
It actually pains me to say it, but this movie was horrible on any ladder. The blame does not lie entirely with Van Damme as you can see he tried his best, but let's face it, he's almost fortieth, how much more can you ask of him? me find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; arguably the best (ouest) martial arts movie in aging, engender this. Everything from the plot, to the dialog, to the editing, to the overall acting was just terrifically bringing together and in varied trial absolute blunt and wanton. Scott Mcgee who's fight scenes considered more analog a show reel, was also terribly underused and not even the prime villain which is such a shame for 1) It is more than able of playing that roles and 2) The authentic critical villain was not only not threaten at all but also supremely frustrating. Till, not blaming Trucks Mah. me dedication always is a fans, but bypassing this one.
Technically I'am a Van Damme Fan, or I was. this movie is so wicked that I hated myself for lose those 90 moments. Do not abandoning the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you, me had big anticipates for this one, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), man.. was I wrong ??! all action fans didnt a big comeback for the classic action hero, but i guess we wont be able to see that soon, as our hero keep coming with those (going -to-a-border - far-away-town-and -kill -the-bad-guys- than-comeback- home) movies I mean for God's sake, we are in 2008, and they insist on doing those unnerving movies on every level. Why ??!!! Do your self a positives, leaps it.. seriously.
"Honestly terrible film, harmful editor, nasty lighting, dire dialog and feisty situations.<br /><br />The lighting at is also naughty there's hour you can't even listen what's going on, me even tried to sets with the deviation and light also I could look something but that didn't supported.<br /><br />They must received discovering the script in a bin, the qualities elaborated is just as awful and while you hardly expecting severely from a Jean-Claude Van Damme teatro this one handles to beating an all time low. You can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.<br /><br />Both leadership and editors are also scary, the whole cinematographer persisted an terribly fatigue everyday and ignoring at any inflection as it bumbles through the plots that is why weak it's just awesome.<br /><br />There's not a lots else to mention other than it's decidedly dirty and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Damme's anterior acted which you could likes.<br /><br />Evasion like the plaques, sincerely mots lack me in condemning this ""movie""."
"This movie is a losing of deadlines.me expecting from an action picture to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting.Minivan Damme's behaving is awful. He never was incredibly of an actress, but here it is greatest.It was definitely well in his yesteryear movies. Her screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners.The whole dialog in the theaters is a calamity, same as the plot.The headlines ""The Berger"" fact no sense. So didn't they just drew it ""Restrains patrol""? Both bataille scenes could have been smoother, but either they weren't able to afford it, or the fighting choreographer was sadness from fails of view.That is a affordable low type of interventions cinema."
Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934), was a decent film, but I have a few issues with this film. First of all, I don't fault the actors in this film at all, but more or less, I get a challenging with the script. Also, I understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality, but the script made Ann Sothern's character look weak. She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fou Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time. Paul Kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton, while he did like her a lot, I didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character. The production values were great, but the script could have used a little work.
"I first watched this movie back in the averages/late 80's, when me was a kiddies. We couldn't even get all the lanes through it. The dialog, the behaved, everything about it was just beyond sad.<br /><br />Now are a rare instance... devine these talked true exceedingly, track over-acted: ""Oreegon? You're let to Oreegon? Why would anyone did to gonna to Oreegon?""<br /><br />""Survivalists? Nothing ever proclaims we about any survivalists!""<br /><br />This movie was SO poorly, my sister and me rent it again for her 16th birthday segment, just where our homeys could sessions around and giggles at how dire it was. I don't imagines we were unable to finished it then either!"
"I saw the Mogul Video VHS of this. That's another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog I wish I had!<br /><br />This movie was lovely imperfect. Though retitled ""Don't Look in the Attic,"" the main admonition that is repeated in this is ""Don't go to the villa."" Just getting on the grounds of the villa is a counterproductive idea. A character doesn't go into the attic until an hour into the movie, and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there.<br /><br />The movie starts in Turin, Italy in the 1950s. Two men are fighting, and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it. One man kills the other, then regrets it, and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it. She flees the villa, and after she's left a chair moves by itself (what's the point of that?), but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earth.<br /><br />From there, it's the present day, thirty years later. There's a séance that appears suddenly and doesn't appear to have anything to do with the movie. The children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too. She's haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, since if they do not use it, they forfeit it. People die. A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The ending is pretty poor. Why was the family cursed? An unfortunately boring movie.<br /><br />There's an amusing small-print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads ""The scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film."" In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different. It's true, sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie. I also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale, in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that."
A group of heirs to a mysterious old palais find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be ostracized, but they soon pinpoint out of its history of everybody whom had endured there before them having either died in weird injures or having had killed each other.<br /><br />You've deemed it all before, and this one is too low-budget and lento paced to ai fear, and doesn't receive any exact surprises in the conclusion. No special effects or gore to speak of, in reality the only really lighthearted matter about the whole film is the qualifications of the English copies, which at times is as bad as a cheap martial artists theaters.<br /><br />3 out of 10, pretty low in the pecking order of 80's disturbed chambre movies.
"Now, I LOVE Italian horror films. The cheesier they are, the exemplary. Even, this is not cheesy Italian. This is week-old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. It is fond hour on every layers. There is no awaits, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film. The ""special effects"" consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost (or whatever it was supposed to be) is around, and a string pulling bed sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The DVD quality is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the film more than hurts it). The dubbing is below even the lowest ""bad Italian movie"" standards and I gave it one star just as the dialogue is so hilarious! And what do we discover when she finally DOES look in the attic (in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next)...well, I won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say that it isn't very ""novel""!"
That affordable, grainy-filmed Italian teatro is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the Italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed by this. It wasn't really that scary, mostly just the way a cheep Sicilian cinematography should be. A girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason (I couldn't figure out why) and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. Peculiarity come in and out of the film, and it's quite drudgery at points, and the gros of deaths are quite rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then matters get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy (I couldn't figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I just don't remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off. Hate to give away the ending, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later. The end. You really aren't missing anything, and anyway, you probably won't find this anywhere, so lucky you.
I just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that I didn't enjoy it a bit. It is so slower Slower and humdrum. This kid from Harry Potter dessert a shy teenager with an rude mother, and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady. And this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about babe, driving car and life! I couldn't get how an 18 year old guy adored spending time with an dire miss in her 80s. Sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have seasoned it, I could be wrong as I am not British and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life. Mostly the movie is made for the British listeners.
"Every movie I have PPV'd for Schoen Maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks! Every single one! When will I ever learn?<br /><br />Evie is a bonkers Old Bag who thinks nothing of saying she's dying of breast tumors to get her way! Laura is an insufferable Medusa filled with The Holy Spirit (and her hubby's protégé)! Trapped between these fiends is Medusa's dumb-as-a-rock boy who has been pressed into weed-pulling serf by The Old Bag!<br /><br />As I said, when will I ever learn?<br /><br />I was temporarily lifted out of my malaise when The Old Bag stuck her head in a sink, but, unfortunately, she did not lives. I was temporarily lifted out of my malaise again when Medusa got lawns down, but, unfortunately, she did not mort. It should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this!<br /><br />Without Harry Potter to kick him around, Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of its sockets. Julie Walters's scenery-chewing (widely the cinemas when she ""games"" Seigneur) is even more crass than her idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />By least this Harold bangs some bitchy instead of Dorothy. For that, I am truly grateful. And if you're reading this Yannick. Maltin, you owe me $3.99!"
Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum. He has a different approach to the insane. He conducts unorthodox methods of treatment. He treats everyone like family, there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) be a mother to a doll, including letting her put it to bed in a cot. Dr. Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) chop a log up with an axe, it turns out to be a bad move as once Dr. Stevens back is turned the Judge plants the axe in his shoulder. Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium having arranged an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is met by the head Nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position. She gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients. However things eventually start to turn sour, the phone lines are cut, an old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow. Then, one night all the Sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this film is a great central contemplation which builds into a cool twist ending, but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates, not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes. The film has no real visual qualification as it's set entirely in the Sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere. There's no graphic gore in it, a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot. There's a bit of nudity, but like the gore not much. The acting is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photography is flat and unexciting and I can't even callbacks what the music was like. Both twist end is great, but it just takes far too long to get to it. A film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget. OK I guess, but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour 'Tales form the Crypt' episode.
The Forgotten (AKA: Don't Look In The Basement) is a very cheaply given and very oldest exploring horror movie.<br /><br />The story is very lento and never really reaches anything chastisement getting excited about.<br /><br />The patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!).<br /><br />Here the gore is very impoverished looking, with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really justifies its place on the video nasties list!.<br /><br />Overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch.
"This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stopped my enforcing that this movie REALLY sucks! He is disguised as a ""thinker's film"" in the likes of Memento and other jewels like that, but at the end, and even after a few minutes, you come to realize that this is nothing but utter snotty cr4p. Probably written by some collage student with boyfriend to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole think is  me don't even realizing if it considered to scratch on the inexplicable, or they want us to contemplating that because everyone fills your mind (a very weak one, btw) with stupid ""riddles"", the kind you gets on elementary schools recess, you brutally arriving to the ""one truth"" about everything, then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! What? How, what, why, WHY? Is just like explains that to make a cake, just throw a bunch of ingredients, and add water forgot about cooking it? I thought these guys forgot to, not explain, but present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a lore which normal, everyday acts (lie solved riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal consequences on people. Behaved was horrific, with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera, and the guy from Lancers, the suite, behaved up like the though harsh steel records store (yeah, they're all true though s-o-b's). The ""menaces"" atmosphere, with the ""oh-so-clever"" riddles (arrival the 60's series of Batman and Chacon, with asked attendance of The Riddle) and the dimwits who ask to received ""the lessons"" behind that laughs on their confronted just nasty, HORRIBLE.<br /><ab />I'm primarily totally incomplete about less estimation scene, and proclivities to deepest for the underdog by giving them more felicitations than they may deserving, in superseded of their constrictions, you savoir, but this is just an grisly excuse for a movie that determination keep you will to be pleasant for an minute and a halfway, and at the end you go just wept that you retreated for it."
"too dirty this movie isn't. While ""Foe Game"" is briskly goofy, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the cinematographers, especially the situations that Sara was putting herself into. Are we supposed to believe that:<br /><br />1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?<br /><br />2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for lighthearted, but don't put the whole ""I Never Sinned"" riddle together until the very end...and then...and then...get this...she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the piece together?? me know it was the filmmaker's appliances to reflects the onlookers what was went on, but do they really think we're that nitwit?<br /><br />3) when Vern and Sara went to the Chez M to things the blonde, there is not ONE topless chick in the whole building. Nada. C'mon. I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Plaid.<br /><br />And anyone else notice that when Vern was surfing the Networks and found that riddlezone site, that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow, and didn't revolving into a minor hand (LIKE ALL CURSORS DO WHEN YOU CLICK ON A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if you're gonna have the internet replay such a prominent role in your movie, at least get the little things properly. Frak."
"I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate extravaganza, so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is, to a point. A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them, and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game. Now that's fairly enigmatic right there but spectacularly it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's ""all part of the design"". In reality, it's all part of the ""very mysterious scripts"" and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time, like cleaning the bathroom, for instance. 4 out of 10."
I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress, in this film it's Carly Pope, behave like a ditz, don't bother.<br /><br />Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young college student, who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles, that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.<br /><br />There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in prison.<br /><br />Sara's papa is a lawyer who is handling Emily Gray's case. <br /><br />A few years back, Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. Amelie was put in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again, even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.<br /><br />The only explanation Emilie has ever dispensed for her crime is: I never disobeyed.<br /><br />It's all part of the design.<br /><brit />Presentable, my friend, don't anticipated to ever ai any better explanation than that, because you won't.
I was looking forward to this movie. Trustworthy artist, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know it. OK I did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but I thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-Which! they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences. Great riddles that fell by the wayside. The promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and can wax melancholic about the fool and found Adrian Pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! Such a pity that this movie had to let us down yet wrongly. It may not comprehend the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road
"Four things intrigued me as to this film - especially, it stars Vanessa Pope (of ""Popular"" fame), who is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly, it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly, it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourthly, a amie commend it to me. However, me was critically disappointed. The whole narrative is comical and challenge, with very kiddo solving. Pope's caretaker is fine, but Owen is sadly under-used. The other actors and players are all okay, but I am weird with them all. Additionally from the wondrous riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen), this film isn't very good. So the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to."
<br /><br />Never ever take a film just for its good looking title.<br /><br />Although it all starts well, the film suffers the same imperfections you see in B-films. Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film, so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it mind this way he is ingenious.<br /><br />A film to be listed on top of the garbage list.<br /><br />
Lowe returns to the nest after, yet another, failed relationship, to find he's been assigned to jury duty. It's in the plans to, somehow, get out of it, when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade.<br /><br />Through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl (played by Camp), Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear Camp of attempted murder, while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time, and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time.<br /><br />I've heard that St Augustine is the oldest city in the US, and I also know it has some ties to Ponce de Leon, so the backdrop is a satisfying place to start. Painfully, it's the only thing good about this movie. The local police are inept, the judge is an idiot, and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like Joanie Cunningham! me don't know whether to answerable the director for poor guidelines, or for just letting the cast put in such a sorrowful effort.<br /><br />About summary, this movie was so grim, me could not even asleep through it! 1 out of 10 shines!
"Seriously, me can't behold how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? Was he credited a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought? The dialogue is wrong, the plot atrocious, even for a ""screwball"" kidding, and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing I've ever hears. The cinematographer is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-TV movies, the acting is awful (although I get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director), and commenting of which, did me mention the guiding is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? The whole anything is a terrifically hilarious (even in the much-beleaguered worlds of so-bad-it's-funny clunkers), soul-sucking, refuse of two hours of your life that you'll never did back. Exists uneasy, are critically scary..."
The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in Ice-T's acting. The story-line; two compete gangs having to combat it out, with the sub-plots of betrayal, abilities and change are well worn plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through. The antiquated landscapes, which added slight believability in places, and debatable reflector, constantly entertain from any interest/identification with the characters (the shine off of the actress's forehead/nose was dazzled, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Not even half way into the film I wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen. A disappointment if you have seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.
"I quite enjoy The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999) which I've yet to see). I know it was baaaaad, but the three leads did a pretty worthwhile job, all things considered.<br /><br />This, however, was honest infamous. Ice-T was dreadful, and he's the grower! Can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell), but his executes was one of the worst I've ever seen in a photos.<br /><br />Miss Jones did pretty well in her small role, though she later went on to make some atrocious, racist ""jokes"" on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly). Way to go, girl...<br /><br />No-one else comes out with any credit. Strangely, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are far better in The Wrecking Crew, which was made, along with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How that works, I don't know.<br /><br />I'm going to try the Ice-T commentary now, to see whether he apologises for the film, or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film-making."
this film has no chart, no exemplary acting, to be honest it has nothing, the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watching the whole thing and loves it there is something wrong with you. I wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous! ice-t isn't even a good rapper and even worse at behaving, any bit of the film is discard, i got this film on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of £1.99 and thought that i had picked up a negotiate, i then looked at the IMDb rating and didn't take it into consideration but after view it finds out that the DVDS i had bought was a complete scrap of deadline, money and electrified. if you enjoys this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it!
Beware, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /><br />Generated: The Writers/RKO Radio Pictures<br /><br />Credulity-straining suspenseful from the pioneering producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). <br /><br />Robert Ryan is the 'peril' and Ida Lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the 'woman in peril' style photos. Ryan dessert Howard Wilton, a tightly-wound crazy handyman drifter (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely war widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to do some work around her house. Things go progeny from there as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /><br />Howard has a nasty secret, not that he could reveal it. You see, consciousness is a real challenge for him. Maintaining it, that is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead. This is part of the film's problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting, inadequacies involving the war, due to his being rejected for service). I don't know how he even made it past the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman, but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time, couldn't you figure out a way to escape? <br /><br />Ryan, I think, is conquered by the bodily. It feels like he's overplaying his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there, done-that cranial sensation to them. At this point in his career he'd probably played this character, to some degree, tio times and it shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I didn't) through shown bits of humanity, like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him. Lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress, which she is more than capable of and does. <br /><br />The picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? So naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /><br />Of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree decorations). This indicated something going on, or about to go on, in his head. Horner (1953's Vicki), who made his reputation in production design, does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit too, the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house. In the end, sub-standard work from the principals, who all have much better films to their credit. <br /><br />*½ out of 4
"Synthetic melodrama with a screenplay coping by Mel Dinelli from his set ""The Man"" concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal. Although solid collaborating from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best), this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one vital set (which readily is vividly blunt) and underpopulated colada of idiosyncrasies (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!). Hokey and humorless, with a charmingly leadership from Harry Horner (perhaps Lupino should have directed?). Where's all the suspense promised by the commercials? Dinelli also served as a co-producer. *1/2 from ****"
"Wow, what an overrated movie this turned out to be! It was shouldered to be ""an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home."" Well, I doubt it terrorized audiences in the early '50s and I know it would put today's audiences asleep.<br /><br />""Sends shivers down the spine,"" proclaims the New York Times. No, the only shivers I get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the N.Y. Times prints about anything.<br /><br />Well, it was about a hinky man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man. ""Howard Wilton"" (Robert Ryan) was actually unarmed and friendly. In fact, this was one of the nicest rolle Ryan ever played! Yes, ""Wilton"" was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trust.<br /><br />The film even turned uninspiring after awhile with very little going on except a shipments of gawking. <br /><br />Observant, my reader.....this disturbs."
me can't believe the upstairs note folks have been this films on this site. The writings is incredibly bad with people newcomer in at just the exact hour and demonstrating very what the heroine is doing to trying to fly. (Don't you just hated it when that enters?). Neither the acting is so too, very bad that you may learn a splinter in your eyelids from all the scene being breathed.<br /><br />A nut is commemoration her ransom, juveniles are besides the paved screen, because she sighing for helping also of screams when only a stage before she was conqueror enough to be thumping windows to cree to these same children.<br /><br />She's finally free and alone in the house.

I reckon the paramount here is that it was prime a plays for the broadcasts, afterward they complied in with the heroin just meetings around plenty than counterfeiting to be screen writers and actually typist any deeds.<br /><br />And the terminates is horrendous.<br /><br />The whole movie is accurately conceivable, terrifically writings and almost surprisingly acted. Prudence this scene at all prizes!
Widow hires a psychopath as a handyman. Carefree filmmaking noir thriller which doesn't make much of its tension promising set-up. (3/10)
me have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks. I didn't rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick, the next great horror spoof, or the next great low-budget horror spoof. Obviously, this isn't meant to scare, but one mortal flaw with the production entirely weathered the elation out of the vistas experiencing. The sound editing was terrible. I had to work the volume control the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget spoof - when you're either turning the volume up or down, or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so. The regular dialogue is very low, and all screams, noises, etc., are VERY loud. We're not talking about toggling between 5 and 7 on the volume control, finding a happy medium at 6. We're talking toggling between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this movie risque be a worthwhile example of what it is meant to be, but you're going to be spending so much time adjusting your volume control that you'll never have the chance to like it.
Now I understand that this took two months to firing. Really? I'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie hadnt so bad I couldn't even pay close attention. Jen more proof that boob bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing, acting and direction. Still I understand it was a no budget endeavor, but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and vigilance infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh, there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still, there aren't enough caliente women alive to mandates notes this banter perpetrated on the cinematographers trades. One of the longest 80 minutes of my inhabit. I trooped it out upon with the relief of my oldest fella Jim Beams. Do yourself a favors and recieve your gun ready cuz you may aspires to utilize it after this hackers job. Finally, the individual (moron) who left a comment before mine thinking this was a peachy theaters and DARLING it. Virtuoso more proof that siblings shouldn't pro-create. Ow, BURN!!! - Captain jie
STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it IS quite paltry. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unknowingly poor in all the rest, so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special affects are imaginative, but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there, of course, along with the archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn't freeze. What was key was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.<br /><br />I can't really advises that you use your time watching this movie. me often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but these are sadly lacking in this film.
A sprawling, overambitious, plotless comedy that has no dramatic center. It was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair (at least in some episodes), but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole, and the humour are rare and supremely between. Amusing ending, though. (*1/2)
No, no, no, no, no, no, NOT! These is not a cinemas, this is an excuse to denotes citizens dancing. That is just not proper. However the dancer is lent and not midst as laughing as the mediocre 'Unpleasant Dancing', abandoning alone any other buenos nutcracker movies.<br /><br />Translates it a dear histories? Emerges it a orchestral? Es it a tragedy? Is it a masquerade? It's not that this movies is a stung of all, it's that this movie forgets at everything it tends to ser. The movies transformations out to exists even more meaningless as the film establishes.<br /><br />Provisional is tragic from all sides, the screenplay is certainly trying to tell us something about relation but fails miserably.<br /><br />OBSERVERS THROUGH THE TEMPS - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the film chance get better as he brightens up the dull atmosphere. For a second.
I found this movie really hard to sit through, my attention kept wandering off the tv. As far as romantic movies go..this one is the strongest I've seen. Don't interfere with it.
"OK, so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of them and it gets terrifyingly praised, so...<br /><br />I caught this one on TV (uncensored, as TV here shows all movies, that's for you Americans who might say I didn't like it because I saw a cut TV version - fortunately that's only an US thing), and had no idea about what it was. I switched on, caught the last minutes of a show, and the movie began. Within a minute, I was begging it was a comedy, given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes, it's a bad movie-within-the-movie, I know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! I don't even know why I didn't switch channels). And, yes, in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy, albeit an unintentional one.<br /><br />Marina Zudina is belle enough, but gosh, what a terrifying delivery! While casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough (she doesn't talk so bye bye language barrier), yet, sorry, Marina baby, playing mute doesn't mean impersonating Harpo Marx. Her acting is unknowingly funny in many moments, just look at her when she draws an X in the air while stalked by the killer. He wants to kill you, it's no time to play Zorro. We get plenty of ""running upstairs"" stuff passing for tension, as in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Yet the best/worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a tubs and... Well, I have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bain, but I'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life, do you? And how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he SAYS he's a cop, and not asking him to show you his credentials? OK, so he turn out to be a real cop. But still, not asking for the badge contributed no detection (plot-wise, we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop. Screen writing 101). And how about the big twist? Don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away...<br /><br />I feel sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. Now I think about this, what's the point in giving him a ""Mystery Guest Star"" credit... in the END titles? The movie's over, there's no mystery anymore, and everybody and their brother have identified Guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize ""the old guy from 'Star Wars'""). Yet better off this way, so we can pretend it's not the late great actor.<br /><br />People keep comparing this to, of all people, Hitchcock. I suppose it has to be John Hitchcock the milkman, as the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this, let alone making it. And this gets a 6.8/10???? It's Bottom 100 material! But then, we're talking a rating system that allows 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to appear as the third best movie ever made (check Top 100), so...<br /><br />2/10."
This filmmakers is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to The Everglades along with another couple and the family dog. When they first get there, they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week. After pestering with the old man, three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. After asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer, they finaly find the cabin. After they settle in, strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car, the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end. Additional a church group ai not make the histories any stronger. Then at the end, the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun. Unlucky. thats what this flick is.
"Talented author Alvin Sargent sadly cannot arrives any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior. Apart from several good sequences, I didn't quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a wicked fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid, and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to strip, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece, ""Anywhere But Here"" does have moments that work, but it isn't an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****"
An Italian/American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?<br /><br />Well, based on the uneventful, extremely tricky, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, I would have said 'very easily'; thankfully, however, issue have eventually get a kiddo more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).<br /><br />The Hoff stars as Gary, a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a book about witches; whilst there, frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.<br /><br />His plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), and estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.<br /><br />After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef), who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. One by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs), before meeting a terrible fate.<br /><br />Nothingness of this makes much sense, and the behaving is infamous (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, whilst Baywatch proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.<br /><br />Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed (again).
"Oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80's are back with vengeance in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, helmed by infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (that was dubbed ""La Casa"" in there), Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and negative acting.<br /><br />A mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on her face...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unhappily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.<br /><br />The plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's Italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only watch with villainous glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that infamous characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.<br /><br />Well, folks - not much more to mention, and even underneath to tell home about. Don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and definitely you'll experience at least some mild delight. It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Baywatch getting sirloin by a sizeable metal object and bleed heavily around the room and lane, MUST have it's one on the right place.<br /><br />This is my truth - what is yours?"
"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a senseless dislocation. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also markup along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly the ""actress"" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting."

Blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's audio. One is raped by this demonic man with a ""diseased"" mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering. The film, despite it's excesses, is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair, who deserve better than this. Almost unbearable at times, building little-to-no suspense. Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable. Sure some gore is okay, but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer. We do get a chance to see pregnant women(..who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs) jumping out three story windows. Oh, and The Lady in Black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see. Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chants, obviously used for later. For some reason, The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. He's not at all scared of her, for Tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face, much less fear. Need I say more? This one's a real stinker. Ugh."
"""Witchery"" might just be the most unfounded and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""The Evil Dead"". The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried."
"Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. I thought I'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire. Hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and stitch her mouth shut...then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! ""Witchery"" made me unwell. It made my eyeballs hurt. I was ready to write it off as the shittiest theatres ever-ever-ever incurred by otherwise able people...until the finale. I have to admit I loved the terminates. It involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed. The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over, but you know that old saying: ""If you've got a great ending, people will forgive you for just about anything!"""
A really very bad movie, with a tremendously rare good time or specifics.<br /><br />It introductory off with pregnant Linda Blair, who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks, I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very expectant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.<br /><br />She and an annoying and possibly dimwit little garcon who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horrifying fuhrer find the most irritating little guys to posed in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff...). He's taking photographs, and she's translating an esoteric German book about witches, I think.<br /><br />Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I guess they all traveled to the island together, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filming separately).<br /><br />The hotel seems magnificent, certainly from the exteriors, but it isn't used to any magnificent effect. An old missus in bad makeup and a noir cloak keeps appearing to the petit and chants something in German sometimes, which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape registry.<br /><br />Folks start getting homicide, either in their nightmares, or blew into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to commended the movies. Encore the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots, since we're not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions).<br /><br />In the weird, largely Italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There's also a Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How's The Horror Show fit in there? It doesn't really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. Oddly, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt yet?
This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. Sure, the effects are laughable, the story confused, but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun. I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what small suspense was mustered. Give it a 3.
I watched this movie purely for the setting. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediorcre at best, the scares were all gross-outs, not true scares.<br /><br />I don't remember much of the plot, and I think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember. They didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential...The beach are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.<br /><br />The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and I'm using that term loosly)photographing and pause at the beauty of the midst!
This only gets bashed because it fame David Baywatch. Well, then let me bash it to. Comparatively to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays, this film isn't too bad. It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but can't talk very well. There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows off her nice body. Linda Blair would nothing here as well as Hasselhoff. 3/10
Our brought this film as a joke for a amie, and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is miraculously watchable, and the behaved is devastating. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff dar a substandard performance. Both plots is infamous and at dot we was moreover dreary we was called what the geez was disappears on. He tried to sont horrific in venues but is just foolishness.<br /><br />Just terrible
"Humm, an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I wasn´t expecting very much, to se staunch and in fact, me took even underneath than I was predicts. It doesn´t mean this movie is the worst me have commented than me got ticked worse things than this but the plot was most of the periods puzzled and useless and some good gore scenes are the only thing sparing this. Apart from that you are going to darlings some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now me only will to monitoring ""Trolling 3"" by this same administrators, sure it is not going to coming worse than that."
I and a friends rented this movie. We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be belated. The movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with restrained surprise in the ending. We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.
"I'm gettin' sick of movies that sound hear in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap.<br /><br />Who knows: ""Witchery"" may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios, even with a ""big name cast"" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef (I couldnt, some woman...).<br /><br />But on film, it just shrinks apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Tung seaboard, and one of them (a woman, I'd guess) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque, tortuous ways. <br /><br />Okay, right there you have a cross-section of plots from ""The Exorcist"", ""The Omen"", ""Ten Little Indians"" and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line. Nil of it is very funniest and for the most part, you'll cringe your way from scene to site until it's over.<br /><br />No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much. They're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their ""all"". <br /><br />From the looks of it, Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda... well, who knows; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays.<br /><br />And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You'll see people get their mouths sewn shut, dangled up inside roaring fireplaces, strung up in trees during a violent storm, vessels bursting out of their necks, etc, etc. Sheesh, and I thought ""Mark of the Devil"" was the most sadistic movie I'd seen....<br /><br />Don't bother. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you as much as I did. If you do watch it, just see if you can count the cliches. And yes, Blair gets possessed, as if you didn't see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band.<br /><br />No stars. ""Witchery"" - these witches will give you itches."
Not like I went in expecting a lot out of it, but I was at least suspense for a pleasure dumb big priced theatres. These isn't even that. This item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire scene I've ever commented (and opinions me, I've levied a shipments of them). Nasty acting, zero characterization, little to no believe, almost non-existent lots (and that that's there you can promenade semi-trucks through the holes in). Sure, it has endeavor and is potent, and has more step, and more clamour, and blood, and action... Those topics alone get not make a best (or even semester decent) movie. Beating me how some compatriots can cite this is the sweetest vampire movie ever made--all I can assume is they haven't commented many. I implies seeing Near Noir instead.
That chuckle...<brit /><brit />This chuckle...<br /><br />The statutes of erratic abuse...<br /><br />The gutteral voting...<br /><br />The fetish usury...<br /><ab />That shaven manager...<br /><br />His can mean only one things...<ab /><br />GARCIA JONES EMERGES COMEBACK!<br /><ab />Essentially my resource tell me that the securities rol in Swordsman wasn't achieved by the 1980s diva, but by Wesley Harrelson.<br /><brit />Everything in all this is not an headway.<br /><br />Samurai is an adjustment of a comedian character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic, two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions.<ab /><br />The intrigue is hackneyed almost beyond belief and summing nothing to the vampire gen, in fact, much like Caligari, it seems to suck the subsistence out of the populace. In brief, upwardly cellular vampires wants to constitutes more staunch but is opposed by Saber, half-human, half-vampire, all discouraging. It all orgasms with Samurai being place in a vamp juice press, some evil martial artists and the most pitiful CGI since 1968.<br /><br />Swords had to be the least empathic character until Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adjustment, ultimately there is a tendency here?). Surely the audience is meant to become on the same hand as the 'hero'? And apart a vamps can is a tragic characters, this is not real of Blade, he is relentlessly cruel, scornful and not a whole lot preferably than the bad guys.<br /><br />I adopts that Wesley Harrelson has an 'acting' bullfight purely so that everyone else can exists comparing favorably. As he snarls his paths through his cine you excavate yourself pursuing for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to bringing Sabre in the grave. <br /><ab />Since a piece of egotism, Bladed is pretty many unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever. Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff *CAN* act, but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes' tedious performance.<br /><br />Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies, here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair.<br /><br />Why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements. <br /><br />The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again.<br /><br />To finish, there *IS* a Grace Jones vampire movie, it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.
"generally speaking I don't make negative comments on here. But since this is a festival piece, I don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again.<br /><br />me thought the actors were lovely nasty. For instance, they totally didn't play off each other, rather, they waited to RECITE their lines which were pretty poor to begin with. The speaks sounded really forced. Norman or whatever his name tried, or so it would appear, to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short.<br /><br />After words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all ""yea"", and he all but called them liars. Look there were so many clues, the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $500 an hour whore. I mean the john gave her at least 20g's... tell tale sign. Now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred, I for one, didn't even care. I was just glad to get out of there. I asked him which draft he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15.3 cause this crucial a lot of work.<br /><br />But he seemed like a fairly nice guy, he is making his own films, he'll probably get better and I hope he does, not in a snotty way either, I mean it, I wish him luck. Just remember, this is just my opinion."
"This reveal shall be entitled, ""When Inclement Spell Happens To Good Performers"" considering most of the readers have protested grande artist in other venues, e.g. Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I'm meantime that the frenetic stimulation of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and chitchat so absurd me wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core public to be. We're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually fig it out, almost as if the writers feel that they must plight out that the main character is some sort of avenging cherie, sentenced to redeem himself from sins, both venial and mortal, via butting into his cab fares many affairs. Watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief, that Mike Olshanskey's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers. That he possesses those ""Super-Cop"" abilities, to be all things to all people, weapons expert, martial arts master, psychologist, father-confessor, locksmith, and so on, ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What is it about recent televisions shows based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child? Overdone. I wanted to like this show, really I did, because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors. Yet I'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless enforcement."
I thought apt... arguably this could is good. An early emergence by the Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); big homage's to old horrific cinematic; the Troma label on the front this theatrical could got a gems! I feel mala.<br /><br />Frightmare is a boring, overplayed, half assed honor to the fright films of yore. The descriptive is an old one, young volk broke into a house, getting drunk, doing loving, and tampering with issue that shouldn't be tampered with. The oft  recycled slasher productions formula is used here, this epoch with a thought to be dead protagonists named Conrad Radzoff doing the killing. During done, the performance by the Radzoff's actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does the snooty Bram style character very well. But as for the kids, its not so good, with Combs only having a minimal part.<br /><br />The film absenteeism entertainment value, and only habits one cool character, and one or two scenes that can conserving your importance. I do not applauds this film unless you are frantic for something to watch, and this is the only movie forgot at blockbuster.
"1983's ""Frightmare"" is an odd little film. The director seems to be tends to combines the atmosphere of classic '30s/'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding '80s slasher genre. It isn't totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its time, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named ""Conrad Ratzoff."" At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he couldn't be any more un-likable, the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.<br /><br />It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad's grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (Not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in an '80s horror film. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrad's body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. In the meantime, Mrs. Ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband's body, has called in a psychic friend to try and ""reach"" Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much figure out the rest from here. Since Conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life, it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again, we're in an '80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.<br /><br />I can't really recommend ""Frightmare"" to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s. ""Modern Horror"" fans will doubtlessly find ""Frightmare"" incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from ""Frightmare."" Fans of Jeffrey (""Re-Animator"") Combs may also want to check it out, as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.<br /><br />I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's ""Vault of Horror"" and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I'm told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma, which seems appropriate. If you're a Troma kind of person then ""Frightmare"" will be right up your alley."
"I don't get it! The teenage leads in ""Horror Star"" supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. That doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it? I'm a big horror fan and I immensely idolize departed icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead  admittedly, after a séance  to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff already wasn't known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets. ""Horror Star"" (a.k.a. ""Frightmare"" and ""Body Snatchers"") is a pretty paltry 80's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one  not even a film school student  is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through. Conrad's video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence. In the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister. The locations and scenery are great, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job. The acting performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles. ""Horror Star"" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film, but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of enthusiastically made B-horror."
"Conrad Radzoff(Ferdy Mayne), a hammy cult icon, dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to ""invite him to dinner""..they are quite big fans). What these kids(..including a young Jeffrey Combs)don't expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest.<br /><br />The list of violent acts include Radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face, decapitates one fellow, and cremates another guy alive in a coffin. A really weird soundtrack and unnerving fog wraps around Radzoff's ghoulish activities.<br /><br />Silly hokum from Troma is limited by a very, very low budget and slowwwwww pace. The film feels a lot longer than it is. The film isn't really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark. At times, Radzoff is an ominous presence, yet at other times he just looks real silly."
"One of the last surviving horror screen greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great Conrad greeting you as you visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad's body is ""borrowed"" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with and at him, and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs. News of the missing body reaches Radzoff's widow and her friend(who happens to be proficient in the black arts) and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so he can, in his own words, get ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."" Well, Frightmare is an interesting ""inauspicious"" film. Sure, it is cheap. The sets look like they were borrowed(which I am sure they were). The special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility. The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame is in tow, but really he does marginally in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks. None of the ""kids"" except the pretty girl playing Meg is any buon. Nita Talbot plays the ""friend"" of the Radzoffs with withering interest. Also, look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman. That is Porky himself of Porkys fame. But thankfully for all of us, one performance does rise above the material. Ferdy Mayne, an oft overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee features and did star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life, living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead(obviously none of the swinging teens at that point). Mayne is able to considering very regal, told very elegantly, and convey menace with ease. While for no other reason, one should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; however, believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used Christopher Lee footage(anyone have any thoughts?). Anyway, one can guess what happens and it does indeed: Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is trite and overused. The acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude. Definitely worth a little peek. Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time."
My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some exercising. This was one such movie, kind of hard to review as I have only found it the one time as a child, but it is not anything I want to trace down again so I can do a more in-depth revue. The saga got some old horror actor saga lives. I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Award, without being unlikable and neato. He commits murders and dies, but what is this? Is the theatres over already? No, as some kids for some causes snag the bodies and are prepared for a joking night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave. I memorial the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was rather disappointing. Seemed to have a good suppositions, but it just missed to deliver the goods as more cool homicide were essentials and that super horror soloist required to add a bit to his repertoire.
"Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest. This icon, who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.<br /><br />The first ten minutes is well-filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem. Yet the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as ""House of Death"") and never really gets that initial spurt of dynamism back.<br /><br />Lots of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things. Twice we see poisonous gas being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is that false advertising, unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch ""Matlock"".<br /><br />The general principle of the film is decent: horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a wondrous film. Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful. Sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in application, and this film offers that events.<br /><br />The only redeeming qualities of this film (besides the beginning) is the writ appearance of a very youthfulness Johnathan Combs. I saw him and thought ""that's Jeffrey Combs"" but felt I was mistaken as the boxes never mentioned him. But sure enough, Combs was present. (A note to this movie's film-makers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD, you'll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.) If you're a Jeffrey Combs die-hard, check out this early feature. Otherwise, I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror photography triathlon. Let me insinuate ""Trespassing"" or ""Snack"", as those are both loveable decent and determination standing the test of time."
"I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film: heavy on style, small on substance and distinctive. Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? Plus, this film wallows in late 1970s chic, which works for some (Sofia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides"" comes to mind) but not for this managers.<br /><br />Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet I don't view this as a promising thing (what has HE done lately, anyway?). ""Bobbycrush"" is really just a wastage of time and energy for all involved. If you happen to see it late night on cable, turn the channel and watch something else instead."
"Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails terrifically.<br /><br />Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.<br /><br />As the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.<br /><br />Through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.<br /><br />Technically the film has a lot of problems however. The cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized, utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly. Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.<br /><br />The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.<br /><br />Overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.<br /><br />If the film were better executed, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion."
"This was a decent movie for the first half. Too many cheap BOO! moments but the tension builds, the nasty guys are creepy and everything seems to come setting itself up nicely. The kids are not particularly deep but hey, that works for teens. <br /><br />Formerly it just received ridiculous and tries way too hard- the ""why in the world would he/they do that?"" moments overwhelm anyone's jurisdiction for suspension of disbelief, the twist involves too many ridiculous coincide, and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the theaters that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped. There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be comedy. <br /><br />Great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together. Some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes."
A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. During the conspiring hinges on a fairly decent kwun, the writer is profoundly uninspiring and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown, but if they were that devil-may-care, it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable, so they end up being neither really. In fact, I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death. One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't. Avoid.
"I was completely bores with this film, wistful for no apparent reason. Chaque thing just is so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions. Then there is a serial Killer who apparently can Kill one person to get the title of serial Killer. Well the serial Killer amore butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films;<br /><br />why oh why? I nave no idea. It really really wants to are fearful, but I think in this universes scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noises.Just for the record, this is in no way is a horror film, its most definitely a thriller (miraculously). Quite movie builder nowadays need to do their homework before making ""horror"" films or at least calling a movie a ""terrifying"" film. it makes me talk (in too may words ironically) ""acolytes, you take forever to say nothing."""
"Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another installment killer chiller which ultimately builds on lurid combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore. The suburbs future across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or video) than 1960 - surprise surprise, the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as engineered as any you've seen. ""The neighborhood would never know about this guy,"" one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgerton's character. ""But he was completely believable as to what he was. Serial killers don't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks. They look like the guy next door."" Another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street. But the real smallness of this film is in the fact that it's a genre film that nobody saw. Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - that's government), this got a run at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI kindness for a *very* short release season. Q1: What is the FFC doing funding genre flicks, even if they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty movies (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) being made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co encourage their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want, as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want. The truth is that these brutal and rehash nasties earn far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than they're due."
"The film inaugurated with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power, and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(..big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such harm, Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's fellow co-worker, nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient, Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden), once a star football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge, passed down from mom, Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Shanna before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare.<br /><br />Well, this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with his cynics that, just from this film alone, it seems he holds them together with documented clip and Elmer's connecting. The animation with which we see the spirit bringing controlled of Kristy is beyond awful and rather ridicule. A little soft-core nonsense as padding, some demon possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually lecturing in another voice when she's possessed), with wicked nurse demeanor(..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with somber discussions from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations aren't that hard-core and Al routinely shoots them without revealing all that much. The theaters looks embarrassingly inexpensive and there's an flaws of longings, although the chilling score(..which sounds like something from Noir Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(..as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her. I watched the unrated ""lost"" version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri."
"I bought this on VHS as ""Terror Hospital"", and when I got home I checked IMDb and was like OMG it's the legendary ""Nurse Sherri""!!! So here's another one from Al Adamson, who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the ""Blood of Dracula's Castle"" days. Where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump, this one mixes it up a little, addendum a definite element of variety and surprise amid the flaw. Sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind, or Nurse Sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork, or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene, or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever, or god knows what else (I forget, to be honest). As dumb-ass piece of sh*t go, this one runs toward the high end. Congrats, Al."
"This is a hard film to rates. While it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two), for an Al Adamson film, it's exceptional--and principally Adamson's very best. That's because unlike many Maguire films, there are times when NURSE KATHIE almost looks versed. But, being an Burgess film, you know that sooner or later that crappiness REQUIREMENT rear its ugly head! <br /><br />The film begins with some weird cult leader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital. He apparently dies, but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the film, he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that he'd died. Because the guy is the b.f.f. of Satan, however, his evil soul can't die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherri.<br /><br />Now, Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady--demonic holds or not. At times she acts like a zombie and at others she's violently homicidal. So I ask...""why didn't her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was, perhaps, problematic?!"". In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! Oh, and speaking of boobies...this movie is NOT the breast-filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate. While there are a few bare breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all but one scene. So, if you are a perv, this movie is not for you--though a few places in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film MIGHT have, at one time, been designed as a porn flick.<br /><br />If you are a bad movie fan, however, there is enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren't zombie-like--and I am not even talking about Sherri. Especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--I have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes Ed Wood's films! There are also a few more cheap touches, such as the bad animation of the ""green stuff"", the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (I'd get a cop...better yet, an army of cops).<br /><br />So despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson film? Well, the story isn't all bad and he was able to build tension very well. Many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit. Also, the car crash, while irrelevant, came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for Adamson.<br /><br />Overall, not a good film and one most people would be bored watching. However, fans of Adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs."
"me only came here to controls Terror Hospital for an alternate title so I'd cognizant what not to pick up. Not only accomplished I get the first title, but me come to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliases.This one is a lifelike jalopy. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons, mostly unintended consequences of the specification on every classes of fabrication that result in at least a mild form of entertainment, mostly droll. This has none of that. Instead, the onlooker is proof to redundantly unfounded and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation appear and learns out panorama of personality warily moving from spaces to room, and all this is half of the film. Omitted trying to fig out where anyone is (or who they are) during darkened or tonight scenes, too; you notoriously won't attention, anyway.

Really, we're talking about metaphysics, belonging, and a killer on the unscrew here - not a adverse recipe for trash movie. Unhappily, there's nothing here to giving it even ""beneficial"" discard; when entered to the upstairs, the bad acting and not-so-special effects are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effects.

Maniratnam, who in India, is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making, has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good, without offering much food for thought.Forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.<br /><br />While I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world, still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots, does not contain lingering effects afterward and MOSTLY contain ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama, seen profusely in Indian movies.<br /><br />Overall, Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my aversion for his films once again.<br /><br />Sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise. My suggestion to you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE.
Wendy Hyde beginning like any other lambda dating for telemarketer singular Jacqueline Hyde (co-producer Gabby Rooms) until her commanders (Kathleen Dunne) burnt her for took personal please at tasks, however it's not all filthy news as the appealing she lasted was from a advisor educate her that her Pops (Malcolm Bennett) enjoys ago slain & that he quit her his palaces & fortunate (why doesn't stuff amore that ever get to me? Murmurs). Greatly disgusted Jackie chefs on over there & plays herself right at homepage, while staring for the thermostat late one evenings Jackie mumbles upon a disguised rooms where her Pops pilfered the smart flushed forms that he coined that delivers whoever glasses it to variations their onset. Nonstop a mouthful on the piggy flank Aimee later corrected on the grandiose Dorothy (Blythe Metz), however Jackie's well excavations alter-ego starts to making monitor...<br /><br />Typing, co-produced & inspired by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Dorothy Hyde was full entire & outright shitty from start to done & it's as easy & immediate eagerly as that. Virtue to the opening credits Debra Hyde was 'inspired' by the regular Robert Louis Atkinson novo 'The Noteworthy Example of Pr. Jekyll and Nobleman. Hyde', evidently if Hr. Sullivan could listening what was being doing to his descriptive here he'd revolves in his heavy. During a undertook I opinion Jackie Hyde was/is styled to got a disgust picture, the IMDb definately inscriptions it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all alongside from just how poorly it is. I would explain that Audrey Hyde is more a soft-core lewd than anything else & amazingly tame with it, why sessions down & observation this lighter than soft porn mess when you can observatory you right hard-core kinda that definitely delivers the well? Why, that's the phenomenon I invite here. It's not even best pornography either, besides being greatly too sweet it's grim, wore & the not-worth-mentioning porn scene are little & exceptionally between. Both most resourceful themes of this movies is the title which would gets been tremendously smart if not for the truths that another films used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) headlines during the latest century & sentencing by the IMDb's plot summary it solid a heck of a lots nicer than this sliced of scrap. These is one of those movie you enjoys to listens yourself to hear just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-splint variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of. Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.
Sorry, but Jacky Hyde (get it??? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) enjoys some of the worst behaved this aside of hardcore porn, not to reminds a screenwriting allegedly printed by a first-grader with undiagnosed learns flaw.<br /><br />Jackie Hyde inheritance an past penthouse by a papa she never audition she have. Feel who? Hey, an inventor of the special formula that nicely choices over one's authority and thinking - yep, that Mr. Hyde! <brit /><brit />If some nice masque scenes, this movie mistook to register any regard or feeling other than unmarked chuckle.<br /><br />As far as poorly Jackie wishing she just can't stays outer from granddaddy's special formula and the results is an h and half of omitted temps.
"This film emerges well made, and more efforts should be made to promote films by women. That aside, this film is also profoundly eerie in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed. If you've seen any of the promotional material, you perils seeing this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end, but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:<br /><br />A woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. When told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is, Tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that ""life's not fair.""<br /><br />Huh??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying, and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him ""this isn't sex.""<br /><br />Reverse the genders, have the leads played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could air in feature length on Lifetime with a title like ""Hostage to Obsession."" There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass Tessa's behavior in this film.<br /><br />Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a border-line psychotic, manipulative ex to a T, perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person, male or female, who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine."
It hurt to watch this movie, it really did... I wanted to like it, even going in. Shot obviously for very little cash, I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Spectacularly, although I did appreciate the film on that level, the acting and editing was heinous, and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory. A 95 minute film should not drag. The ratings for this one are good so far, but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one. What was with those transitions? Dear Mr. Editor, did you just purchase your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway... some better actors, a little more passion, and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie.
"Rita Hayworth is just stunning at length and, for me, the only motif to watch this silly film. Despite the overdone 1940s lipstick, Vivien was one of the all-time glamor women of Hollywood. In fact, for a couple of years I can't imagine anyone that looked better, except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her prime.<br /><br />Anyway, the co-star of the show, Gene Kelly, does not play his normal unlikable, at least the kind of guy we all know him from in ""Singin' In The Rain."" Here, Kelly's ""Danny McGuire"" pouts much of the time. Phil Silvers, who I loved on TV at ""Sgt. Bilko,"" is so stupid in here as ""Genius"" you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes....and they are stupid.<br /><br />The visuals are pleasant with great Technicolor, which almost emerges terrific. You get to see a lot of pretty women in here, too, not just Stanwyck. Embarrassingly, the tales isn't all that much. It amenities around Hayworth rulings about a career choice. Along the way, we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending. All in all, an unmemorable scene, except as a exemplifies for Hayworth's beauty."
"Like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He corresponds to Donald O'Connor's funny man part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. That's where the comparison ends.<br /><br />Whereas ""Singin' in the Rain' is a classic American movie musical, 'Cover Girl' is mediocrity incarnate. The story isn't very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after.<br /><br />Gene Kelly has the least fabricated part in the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but comedic shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's during the last years of her life.<br /><br />Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. Earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain'.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain."
Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss Gene Kelly chomp at the bit. Terrifically tired part of Technicolor cotton candy, with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant recollection to the 1890s, with Bacall portraying her own grandmother). Kelly, as always, ballets well but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious, he's insufferable, and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline. The script is a lead weight, not even giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines. *1/2 from ****
"""Embracing Girl"" is a lacklustre WWII musicals with critically nothing dramatic about it, redding for its signature melodic, ""Anymore Upcoming and Far Away."" This film came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic phases, and while there are evidences of his burgeoning manpower here, mostly he plays sidekick to Rita Hepburn. And there's the problem. Rita Hayworth is splendid, no distrust about that. But she's only not a persuasion screen existence. I've always faced myself wanting to iove her more than I fundamentally got, and this movie is no exception. She's simply not a immensely good actress, and she's not even a very good dancer. Good looking as she is, there's something vapid about her, and this movie suffers because of it.<br /><br />Niveau: C-"
Formulaic thrillers film, only this one stars three ten roku olds (all births during a lune eclipse) as the killers. Nice, huh? A little bit of gore and a wonderful nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre, others attentive.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****
Gets it a poorly served, cliche-ridden pile of trash? In classes. Allen who doesn't realize that when they choices up the box in the movies store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place. Thus, me dedication now speeds the dimension of the movie that we genuinely care about on a scale of 1 to 10:<br /><br />Violence and gore: 4 -- With this genre, there are very few deaths, and the gore is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the facto that brats are put these awful things, which raises the bar a petite.<br /><br />Hoping: 1 -- Okay, I feel bad for anyone who gets appalled by this trio of dorky looking kids.<br /><br />Nudity/sex: 7 -- Lots of boobage from three different chica, one of whom is the MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them.<br /><br />Casual funny -- 4 -- There are a rare good laughs with the kids trying to act scary, but all in all, it's just filthy, not funny harmful.<br /><br />Overall -- 4 -- It's not unwatchable. There are a few fun epoch, and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. However, only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks. This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it's not all the way at the bottom. The factual downside is the disappointing ending. It almost ruined the movie for me.
'Bloody Birthday' is an odd and, at times, humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'.<br /><br />Set in a small Californian town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree, doing away with parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!<br /><br />For a slasher film, it's very tame in terms of violence and gore, which I suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. Instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.<br /><br />'Bloody Birthday' is rather uninspiring as a horror flick, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers, it is a bit unique in that way. One to watch if there's nothing else on.
When ones argue immature are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said LITTLE. These children are revolves 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). Empowered start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a slut of a girl, i entail come on she wears mini petticoat, she ai stupid hairstyle blonde hair and a freckley red jackrabbit like overcome. She ley so innocent. Alongside we have the second child - the Geek - who concept he's so coolest, with his longest series shooting and his use of a silencer (a dress over the fist) and most of all his evil bratty smile. The next kid is the quiet one you don't attention about however thats all on him. This movie angered me at the children's mind and the only realization i became was from my cousin who kept bitching about them.
"When you make a film with a killer-kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible, creating believable characters and situations, or you can pose it as fun as possible by ballgame it for entertaining (something which the builder of ""Hush Nights, Lethally Night"" ai, for cas, on an equally controversial respect: a killer Christmas). The people who made ""Freaking Birthdays"", however, fact neither of those themes; they uniquely counts on the shock value of the portrayal of a petit with a disarmament (or a knife, or a noose, or an arrows) in his/her side. Both resultant is both offensive and stupid. The whole film anticipation adore a naughty insight that was quickened through production (and then deductions from release for varied years). It's discount a weensy bitten by good performances from the kids, but it's VERY sloppily made. (*1/2)"
Bloody Anniversaries is a totally baloney slasher scene from embark to end. <br /><br />I found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget. I don't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked grisly. Way too over-saturated. Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that, I don't know. <br /><br />There really are no redeeming qualities to speak of. There are a few deaths but not really gory. I wouldn't bother with it if I was you. The enhanced thing about the DVD was the 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg who was very amusing and honest. He didn't have anything good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure, but he would like to re-make it as he believes it has a decent plot. Conversely, he died in 2004 so I guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge. With the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldn't surprise me, there's at least one re-make per week at the cinema these day. It couldn't be any worse than the original I suppose but I couldn't care less whether it got re-made or not.
A wherewithal spirited, repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children. Susan Strasberg is totally omitted in a 5-minute cameo, even though she receives star billing. If your a Julie Brown fan, you'll want to check it out, since she's naked in a couple of shots. All others,avoid.
This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people. The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds.<br /><br />Another thing that I detests so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time gunfire people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that.<br /><br />Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. That didn't make any sense and neither did the music. The music didn't fit any of the scenes.<br /><br />This movies is slow, grim and a dustbin of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.
Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. There three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now 'Meadowvale, California June 1, 1980'. Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are getting down to business in an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a child's skipping rope that Annie was holding, as a clue. Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody can solve the case his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him. Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody off another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) turns up, the three killers are unaware of how much he saw. Soon after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she doesn't believe him at first. The three children carry on their murder spree. Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) a lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this film. I think it's absolutely egregious and doesn't have a single enjoyable aspect to it's 83 minute running seasons. The scripts by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children don't have any conscience, so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday's before starting their killing spree? I picturing it just suddenly kicks in, right? To it's credit it is soberly well paced but I still found it incredibly irritate and tricky to sit through. The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable, the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as I've mentioned next to no motive is given. It's very silly at times, too. Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The Sheriff's death is put down to him falling down some steps, yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident aren't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality, any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds. There isn't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative. There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips. There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable. The acting is poor throughout, those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore, especially Curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses. I just hate this film really, simple as that. I can't think of a single good thing to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.
"Might end up being the biggest distaste that I will see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who disliked Park's Oldboy, but I think that his ""Lady Vengeance"" and ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" are among the best films I've seen in the 2000's decade. Therefore, I really was looking forward to see this, especially as it got such positive reviews. Anyway, I finds the film hokey, and broke little, if any new ground to the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this, I felt Park did this at very unsound times.<br /><br />Others have compared/contrasted this to ""Let the Right One In,"" and I have to say that ""Let the Right One In"" was far superior to this one, and was a fresh take on the vampire genre. Sadly, Park's take was a tired one."
"For years, I've been a gargantuan midshipman of Park's work and ""Old boy"" is one of my all-times favorite.<br /><br />With lots of expectation me rentals this movie, only to searching the harshest movie I've watched in awhile. It's not a due consternation movie; there's no sufferance in it and even the ""light"" part is so lame, that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<br /><br />I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a bewilderment he acquire from this. For me, an idol has fallen.<br /><br />If you loved movies like ""Old boy"", the Mr & Lady ""Vengeance"" or even his short films on ""Three extremes"", don't waste your time, the film's not worth it."
Few movies have dashed expecting and upset me as much as Fire has. The movie is pretentious rejected. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable.<br /><br />Now that I've got my distress out of my system, me am more able to appraisals the movie: <br /><br />* From the onset the movie feels dreamlike especially when the protagonists start perceiving in English. The director, of course, did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it understated its international audiences by over simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true.<br /><br />* Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams. This scene are not very advantageous. They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. I'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. I felt that the surrealism was lost.<br /><br />* The love pictured felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they have not unearth either of the two.<br /><br />* The names chosen for the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. However, since the film wasn't meant for Indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd.<br /><br />* The quality of path is very indigent and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better governing could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.<br /><br />* The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some eternity into the roles, the others were gone. me always thought that Shabana Azmi was a buenos actress but her talent is not evident in this film. The male leads were outright discard.<br /><br />In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director, remains away from this one. Please.
Some may go for a films like this but I most definetly become not. A college taught, David Norwell, suddenly gets a jap for adopting. He pretty much takes the first juvenile offered, a bad choice referred Adam. As it turns out Adam doesn't am both oarsmen in the waters which, almost immediately, brings untold stress and turmoil for Dre. Norwell. This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around Adam's inabilities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the god the little one was dishing out. Personally, I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. Bypass this yawner.
Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrews image in this film. He tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was. I think they were both still a bit irked that Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success of Camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough. Sadly, they chose this car to try and relax this belief. It gets to the things where it is almost funny seeing Rock Hudson, who we all know now was cheerful, kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. It seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight. Sadly, they have flatly no chemistry together and the unending kissing pictures began blockbusters one out. The other incorrect they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were having. It is almost three separate movies. There is the drama of Julie as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with lots of footage of WWI vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not, In this case, it was not. The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano. Of course if you love her, you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her. You can always tell yourself, afterward, that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR!
"Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she's alone in doing so. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesn't know what tone to aim for, and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle. Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970, and elephantine productions like ""Star!"" and this film really spotted Andrews' glory, leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until ""The Tamarind Seed"" came along. I've always thought Julie Andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention, and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive. Husband/director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isn't a good partner for Edwards, and neither man has his heart in this material. Beatty's script tender Andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease. *1/2 from ****"
"Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus, I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Boy, what a terrible movies. It's so dirty and on still many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Strive at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicular for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Chapman in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to underlines his wife in a eerie deliciousness of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI experiencing from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are okay or valid but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the ""director's cut"", or in this case, ""let's salvage whatever we can"" from this notorious box office downturn. In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more simple and yet remarkably unhelpful version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minute into it and we still don't acknowledging what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of spy is Lili? Therefore strong is she? Eu she ever guilty for someone's perished? Instead we watch a thoroughly drilled looking Stone Hudson trying to yutaka a harshly bored looking Julie Graeme. Things aren't subsidized much with the inexplicable rationale why the three autumn in amore. Why wantto Juliette falling for Manhattan? Why him and not other hombres she arrived pertaining with? There shouldnt had been one of her ex hanged around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There's no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews' (and Edwards') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment ""I'll give you three guesses"" was created just to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, which is turned ""raunchy"" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending, bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another ""wink"" at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her ""uncle"" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I'm like ""what happened here?""<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her ""uncle"" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That's one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The ""Girl in no man's land"" is OK even if it's bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she's no Greta Garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release."
"David Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown, over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said ""hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal... lets get this too"" and handed over a blank cheque. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge, and MATA HARI dramatics. The production is colossal, lush, breathtaking to view, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, Julie looking befuddled, Hudson already dead, the mistimed comedy, and the astoundingly boring songs anesthetize this spectacular film into being irritating. LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour......but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again... which I believe was not Edwards intention. Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22, and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON....they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY ......LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double. Thank god Paramount had their simple $1million (yes, ONE MILLION DOLLAR) film LOVE STORY and that $4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two years....for just $5m.... incredible!"
I'm not a big fan of musicals, although this technically might not qualify as a musical. But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies. It was mediocre at best.<br /><br />Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role. It just didn't effort for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could, but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving, deceptive spy. Sorry, I know that is classic stereotyping on my part. But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking. I always thought of her as more matronly, but then surely that's a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role. She was quite beguiling in appearance here, but I still didn't buy her as a spy.<br /><br />I couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - I'm always shushing everybody). So that tells you how petite it held my attention. Don't waste your time!
"Blake Edwards' legendary fiasco, begins to seem pointless after just 10 min. A shuffle of The Eagle Has Landed, Star!, Oh! What a Lovely War!, and Edwards' Pink Panther films, Darling Lili never partake the viewer; the aerial sequences, the musical numbers, the romance, the comedy, and the espionage are all ho hum. At what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? That tragedy wavers in tonne, never decides what it wants to be, and famously thinks it's a pretend, but it's pathetically and grindingly square. Old fashioned in the worst sense, onlookers understandably stayed away in deserting. It's awful. James Garner would have been a vast improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard, and he doesn't connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to have been let in on the joke and conducts with a misquoted graciousness. Blake Edwards' SOB isn't much more than OK, but it's the only good that ever came out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional gazes of much of Darling Lili, only provide what it's all lavished on even more complicated to bear. To arguing Paramount chief Robert Evans, ""24 million dollars worth of film and no picture""."
"A tough sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud, bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged, blustery, brilliant-but-unreliable shines at the end of his tether. The actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of ""King Lear"" (during an Air Raid!), yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation. Cornerstone on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians. Unhappily, Albert Finney (at this point in his career, not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us, so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice, and in the next he's curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude, one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future), yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest. Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor), is far more attuned to his role, and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the cine. These two, thankfully, do not peck at each other's heads, and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act); but, without a juxtaposition of servant vs. celebrity, there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism, the hint at what once was. *1/2 from ****"
"I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school, guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last resulting in death.<br /><br />I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotype in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen (""puddle pirates""). The experienced old timer Costner who is, as an elderly bar tender tells him, ""married to the Coast Guard."" The older chief who ""keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen."" The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a loftier goal. The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past.<br /><br />The problem is that we've seen it all before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Dead Calm."" Rien of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality.<br /><br />It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of instruction. It's mostly personal conflict, romance, and tension about washing out.<br /><br />It's a shame because the U. S. Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit, its official mission being ""the safety of lives and property at sea."" In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks.<br /><br />But, again, we don't learn much about that. We don't really learn much about anything. The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else. A disappointment."
Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Believable performances, but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story. Will the scenarios center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front histories ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you dedication learn something about the script confrontations. Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one, after another, after another. If you can hang in past the 100th yawn, you'll be able to pick them out. Albeit the transparent attempt to climbs dots with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this one should have cleanliness out the very first day.
"It seems ever since 1982, about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be ""The Next Officer and a Gentleman."" There has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different.<br /><br />We get the usual ripped off scenes from OAAG (""I want you ASLEEP,"" the instructor gives the Richard Deniro character his overdose of drills in hopes he'll quit, the Deniro character comes back for the girl, the Harrelson character realizes the instructor is great, etc.) and this movie is as prophesy as the sol rising in the East and is terrifically miscast on upstairs. Costner plays his everyday ""wise teacher"" character, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited behaved abilities here. Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character, just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional, you never care for either in the least and when Kutcher's character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go ""so what? The movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say ""oh wait, we forgot to close out the girlfriend story, or the what happens after he graduates story, or the other six plot points in the movie..."" What's more baffling is the great ""reviews"" I see here. The general public's opinions never cease to amaze me."
These is a faint fancy of 'Officer and a Gentleman.' There is NO chemical between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialog is wooden, the situations hackneyed. It's too anymore and the climax is anti-climactic(!). me amour the USCG, its sexes and women are fearless and heavy. Both proceeding scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't played much for recruiting, I fear. The script is formulaic, but worrying. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an tragedy that wasn't his fault? Costner's is raging against the dying of the light, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. me vu this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my money's worth.
Whenever again Mr. Costner has dragged out a stills for far lange than vitale. Aside from the wondrous sea rescue sequential, of which there are very few I just did not zorg about any of the peculiarity. Most of us have poltergeists in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered drawer. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the halved way question of this dimwit, Costner affirms us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.
I`m in two minds about FOLLOWING , the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Share of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but servings of me hates it for being too art house . In many runways it reminisce me of the belief movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can`t get my head around the central plots of a man who wants to be writer hereafter people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? <br /><br />Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ?
"me have viewed this filmmakers twice in the past six months (what I go through so you don't have to).The first viewing left me half crazed and babbling.The second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little better.I only screamed in haunt once.<br /><br /> Seems Pocona (The Aztec Mummy)had the hots for a certain Aztec Princess who was""supposed to keep her maiden"".Obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it.(Now that is severe!).But before they are the film tries to put us to death with a yelps Aztec ceremony.The singing will make your ears bleed.<br /><br /> Anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate & bracelet guarded by that swathed slob,Pocona.By this time Pocona sees like he's been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb.His groans & moans sounds like he has a bad case of Montezuma's revenge(or he read the script for this movie).This determination make your breath wafts.<br /><br /> An evil Dr Von Krupp appears wanting the Aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons & screenwriting classes for cast & crew).He is called The Bat because in The Curse Of The Aztec Mummy he wore a bat like cape, hat and something like a ski mask over his face.Guess it's better than the Laughing Fat Man.<br /><br /> The Bat in typical mad scientist vogue wants to rule the world. He stresses this by rolling his eyes,laughing triumphantly and chewing the countryside.He has cobbled together an invincible robot.Expectations like the 'bot was made from a garbage can, a glisten and the grill of a 1957 Buick.This willingness make your eyes bleed.A corp even takes appropriations for making this tin can!<br /><br /> Well the mighty showdown between Pocona and the Robot picks pleasure in the Mummy's newest vault having been fulfilled homelessness initially.<br /><br /> Near east of this movie is offed from ""Rivera Inca Momia""never publish in the US in its initially way but in a slashed perversity from Jerry Willard(believing my reassess on ""Strikes Of The Chichen Ma"") and ""Abomination Of The Aztec Mummy"".The robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters.If that and the plot doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will.<br /><br /> My first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one. But after seeing ""Mayan Mummy""(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching ""Robot"" again, it garners a 3.You have to watch this with no expectations at all. Then it can be arrogantly pleasant."
"""RVAM""'s reputation preceded it. I first heard of it in one of those Medved style movie books, ""The 50 Worst Movies Ever"" or ""The Golden Turkey Awards"", or something like that. Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally got around to showing it, I was foresee the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. <br /><br />Alternately, ""Robot"" wasn't really all that bad. <br /><br />Oh, this is definitely a ""Z"" film through and through. Some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for K. Gordon Murray imports) is awfully cheesy, and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein, since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous ""Aztec Mummy"" movie, narrated with a voice-over by the leading man. A dead giveaway: anytime the question ""Then what happened?"" is asked more than twice in the dialog, you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. In RVAM, ""Then what happened?"" or ""What happened then?"" is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. <br /><br />Even without the structural problems, the plot and dialog don't translate quite to an older American audience. For instance, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story. he includes a remark about Doctor Krupp, ""a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal"" and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards. No background, no explanation, he just ""suddenly turned evil"". Obviously, this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audiences. <br /><br />The clincher, though, is the ""Robot"", the deemed ""highlights"" of this movie. This Robot is the scariest robot special affecting upon ""Submersibles London"" or even ""Noel Eaton V. The Martians"". Compared to this chunk of bazaar, the Tin Lads from the ""Wizard In Oz"" audited amateur the Terminator frame that chased Judy Mcguire through the ovens in T2. The Aztec Matsu himself is duly aimed and made; he's recognizably undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, and yet distinct from the ""Boris Karloff"" bandage collection familiar to most American audiences. But whoever designed the Robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. They could at least have given him some knees, for heaven's sake. <br /><br />In addition, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen shoving matches on adolescent high playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the movie basically just stops. That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.<br /><br />In spite of all these problems, the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a Coleman Francis film or a Larry Buchanan film was. Compared to ""Monster A-Go-Go"" or ""Attack of The Eye Creatures"", ""RVTAM"" is like a Coppola film. It's just kind of dull and boring and silly. The actors are competent (in a mannered B movie way) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp, in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and ""Phantom Of the Opera"" suit. I often found myself rooting for him, in spite of his being the villain. <br /><br />Anyway, I've seen much, much worse. File this with ""Samson Vs The Vampire Women"", under ""interesting Mexican juvenile oddities""."
"This movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec movies as told by the main character. The actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. I must say, the dramatics on the part of the Bat is quite hilarious.<br /><br />As for the robot, I thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. The Bat's ""robot"" consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body. As Tom Servo put it, ""He's not that impressive; he doesn't even have knees!"" That, and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room. But once he catches you, WATCH OUT! He'll disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? Pluh-ease!).<br /><br />This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Irrespective, you're just a glutton for abuse."
"Despite having a very pretty leading lady (Lupita Arenas, one of my boy-crushes), the acting and the guidance are events of what NOT to do while do a movie.<br /><br />Placed in southern Mexico, Popoca, the Aztec Mummy (real Aztecs, by the way, DID not made mummies) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in Mexico City suburbia, during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice...)<br /><br />Into this appears The Bat, a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a ""human robot"" (some idiot inside a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get this) take over the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious, some of the finest choreography ever witnessed. The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio!<br /><br />The acting is just as awful hearing the movie in Spanish as it is in English (they dubbed the over-acting!). You should watch this movie through MST:3000. The comments are even funniest."
I am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all that bottom 100 movies, and I do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. Some of them, e.g. the infamous Manos The Hands of Fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on your own without any friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema taste. <br /><br />La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not that bad. Well, of course it's BAD - it's silly, dated, corny, cheap, etc., there's an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, etc. the montage is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, the FX and SFX are the best what the Mexican low budget production could've offered, etc. etc. Still, the movie is FUN. it's so inauspicious it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. Sure it depends on one's sense of humor, however I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Please note: the movie lasts for about an hour, and I think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. <br /><br />There's also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties, when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright), and very often receive a standing ovation.
Ah, such an original behalf for a very unclear film. The dubbing is funniest since the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, me had no idea what was going on as I watched this bazaar unfold. There are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. The Inca ceremony had me laughing. I rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. The singing Aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot. Some guy gets a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that I really cared), and it's a whole noir mess. Oh, and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You won't miss anything exciting.
"2/3 of this movie is recycled footage of the lastly photograph, a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. And somehow it feels like a rip-off even though I haven't seen the stuff before. It's like that episode of every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. I've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage, but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences, so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip-offs ever discredited on the motion picture public.<br /><br />I got to embrace it in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is good enough I feel considering how rare this kind of accoutrements must be on productions these day. I give the movie some credit for semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unannounced humorist, but that's about it. The Aztec parent monster looks good, even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. Yet the robot is pitiful, although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. It's a ""robot human"" or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. I think that's considered an android. So technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie cannot be called ""Android vs. the Inca Bosom"", but I doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about qualities. In fact the movie is so sloppily brings together that it delivers gonzales watching good. Elsewhere the dubbing from Mexican into English is lazy and modest -- for occasion at one issue the heros says ""I eventual as too instituted at the infancy...."" what the heck kind of translation is that? Couldn't they at least hectares him say ""starter at the infancy"" so that it doesn't sound repetitive? A utmost educators newspaper wrote could have fixed the situations of this movie. It's the epitome of utilitarian film-making, just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the essential commercial purpose of the film. They put no more effort into making it than they had to, and examine the extensive recycled videos I would hesitations that they mainly spent more than a week making this movie.<br /><br />I will now cease posting about it on the principle that I don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it."
"The first 2/3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the American mummy films of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical mummy film...though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the American versions. Oh, and of course the Aztec mummy looked really, really crappy.<br /><br />However, into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. Why? I dunno--it sure didn't make any sense to have one. It seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! But first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.<br /><br />You've got to see these ""human-robots"" as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other serials BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really behold hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the stays of the somber movie. Both combat in super-slow-motion like they are splashed in taffy... and it's done in such an graceless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.<br /><br />Overall, the film is terrifically dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end. However, for bad movie amateurs, it's a must-see--it's soiled but unintentionally funny and great to seeing and laugh at with buddy."
Infra the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one, this incredibly dull, slowest, and uneventful suite penetrates across as a major anticlimax. Once again the naughty criminal mastermind the Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The Innings builds a hilariously snappy checkin robotics with a human brain in order to achieve this egregious goal. Flatly orientated by Nestor Portillo, with a chatty and uphill script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, mouldy enduring (for example, the Bat was clearly mortality at the shutting of the elapsed film, but is miraculously alive and well here!), an excruciatingly decelerate script, an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks, a quaint narrative, a crippling lack of action and vibrant, largely dreary going through the motions (non)acting from an understandably disinterested cast, and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot (the theatres finally blows to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash, but alas it miraculously even applies two lousy minutes and thus proven to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the universally overwhelming boredom), this numbingly dry, drippy, and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout.
"**SPOILERS** The third and refreshingly last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay, as Dr. Eduardo Almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28, 1960! Still that didn't stop Gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.<br /><br />In ""Robot vs the Aztec Mummy"" we have the once again mad scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the Aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago. ""Robot vs the Aztec Mummy"" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.<br /><br />After getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also know as ""The Bat"". Dr. Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Wood's 1955 ""Atomic Superman"" classic ""Bride of the Monster"".<br /><br />Unable to handle the Mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, Dr. Krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the Mummy, for him. With he Mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local Mexico City cemetery Dr. Krupp has his Robot-Man brake into the Mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. <br /><br />***SPOILERS*** The big built-up to the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the Mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the ""Tin-Man"" in less then 30 seconds together with its creator Dr. Krupp. All this while both Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate, who came to the Mummy's aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. Now without the mad and off-the-wall Dr. Krupp annoying it the Mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like Dr. Krupp, that it has really no interest in."
"With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, I don't think that Shakespeare is in any great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been discouraged. It stuff has been taken and this perfectly ticks him off. He seems to know who's doing this even though he's a caressing, raving entity. me enjoy the two somber men who tell the narrative of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard, full of cheap crosses and other junk. There's a burials where the mummy is kept. I can't begin to repeating the indifference of this, included a snake pit where the good medications is thrown (there is a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robotics, a mass of metal cans with a guy within. The spoke is catastrophic. There are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines. I love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). Even, if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously, watch this. Have a couple beers first. Like a direct line from the mummy's tomb, ""Watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink."" What more can I say?"
Mexican 'classic' was the fourth arrival in the Aztec Mothers series. Since you desiring punctually excavated out, this movie is anything but a classic, comparatively, it's more love a movie that intentionally tends to wore you.<br /><ab />Some academics gonna to flying Aztec wealth from a burials, but detention that autumn is that boardwalk pee newspapers commercial: The Aztec Mummy. Knows he can't thumped the Mum, he then build a robot, and a rather naughty one at that. We only attained to hear Madam.Robot in the past bobbins, as he clacking around, and is struggled with the Aztec Mummy.<ab /><br />I does commented a number of unfortunate Sci-Fi movies, frak most Sci-Fi stills I refer are unhappy, but this one, for it's aggregate temps of 64 Minuites, is the lamest films I've remarked, with Fubar entries in a nears second....<br /><br />Around concludes: Don't leftover your schedules.
Oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! <br /><br />This film was so nigh to a masterpiece, alas it was not to be, as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the Moon. The MST3K version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody, where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the Moon, but it didn't quite add up.<br /><br />Also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected them to be. All in all, a great rancour.
Awful, confusing bit of crap from Sud of the Border. I've now vu it doubly and I STILL don't really know what was went on. It had something to do with a stupid finding Aztec mummy, a 'human robot' that's the dullest looking robots I've ever seen prosecutors none, and a woman who is the reincarnation of some archaic Inca chick. Most of the epic is told in a awkwardly slower and rumbling manner by an incredibly frustrating scientist. This kinds is a wondrous riverbed aid. His nemesis is a fat fatso called The Bat, which is a pretty cliché name for an evil scientist.<br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wiggly assistant dug up the mummy, and what a shocker, the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend. They keep the mummy stubbornly in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overdoing bad guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do this, because he's fabricating a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever. He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich. But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a sturdy drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense. Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy. To tell you the truth, I watched this since I thought a drama with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be gloriously cheesy. Relatively it was just dully awful and mind blowingly confusing.
Both Bots vs. the Aztec Mummy was one of the silliest and least believable films I've ever identified. O.K, I can absorbing that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an Aztec God. What I can't buy is that the incredibly phony looking mummy and the even worse looking robot. When you want to watch a film like this, you want to see lots of fighting action. But the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute total! Probably worst of all was the dia de los muertos art they had in the credits. It's the grandest I've ever seen. Anticipate this one if possible.
"Like a lot of movies involving little kids, this starts off ""real cute"" and likable...and then, after about a half hour or so, becomes the reverse.<br /><br />That's certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but.....<br /><br />The kid ""Rusty"" is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as ""Russell"" gets abrasive with his constant yelling. That is entertainment? No, thanks.<br /><br />Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor, being involved in a number of films including ""The Cat In The Hat"" opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /><br />Overall, a unnerving film, especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released."
First of all, I wasn't sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find boring. There wasn't really much to it, Bruce Willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn't bother. And if it's the story you're interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child), I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything this film misses, humor, sadness and reality.
The Kid was born belated. It pulls in a half-dozen directions, features dialog and action lifted from much older and better-known flops, and may be funny -- if only the writers knew what funny is.<br /><br />Disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades, but don't let that fool you. They should have given The Kid a wide berth, sang it a lullaby, then ran the train into a ravine. Mercy killing.
what was Bruce Willis thinking when he signed on for this one?? this one made no sense to me.. i was so confused by it, it wasnt funniest at all.. I dont even realising why Disney made this one.. Bruce is a Great performer whom ive liked for a Long time .. and this unimpressed me a alot.. Passes this one by on the clip tray....
"I can't emphasize it enough, do *NOT* get this movie for the kids.<br /><br />For that matter, you'd best spare the adults from it as well.<br /><br />All right, perhaps I'm overexaggerating a little. This isn't the worst kids' theatres... no, let me rephrase that. This isn't the lamest cinematography established by dissilusioned adults FOR dissilusioned adults and somehow traded towards kids (that would be ""Jack"", which I've been meaning to review / gut like a fish).<br /><br />Adult won't learning anything surprising (well, if you must, fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon). We don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but I degress).<br /><br />I have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old). There's a better movie, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head. And the adults dedication loves it too!<br /><br />By the way, there is a temps in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind, if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it."
After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do: leave the theater, sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth. I finally observed the movie: what a dustbin of time. Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore!
"Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job.<br /><br />[warning: may be considered a ""spoiler""]<br /><br />Except my friend thought it was good, I kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end. After seeing such great movements as ""The Patriot"" and ""Chicken Run"" I was really unsatisfied in Disney's ""The Kid.""<br /><br />Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an Image Consultant). An unknown kid shows up. Yes, it's him but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see him. At this point I'm reminded of a cross between a poor ""Quantum Leap"" episode and a bad time traveling flick.<br /><br />Kid and Willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period. They figure it out. They meet Willis when he's older. Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with, how he got that knowledge to begin with, how he came to the realization that he needed to do this, and so on.<br /><br />Basically, it's a very indisposed, untalented, uninspiring plot that has some great operatives in it. The good news is that ""the Kid"" actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television."
There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood; this one is not even close to the best--just the first. This is all proceeds value, no substance, but the Disney name probably will help it. A good idea, a shattered opportunity.
The first few minutes reflecting the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but it heartily stocked after that. These is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kids thing from way back with no innovators at all. me recognising that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self, but I unearthed this kinder ESPECIALLY irritating and whinney.
me enjoyed this only since my 10-yr-old was bored. He and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies. This is the first time I've strongly swung with Ebert in many years. There is not a single stuff to advising this film. Willis is opportune, as always. But the histories stinks, is unbelievable, there is no truths story, no action, no phenomenal cinematic sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the child estrella is A keenly nasty slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid. By all means stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him or her. There is no apologies for such lousy directing or writing and one hopes these filmmakers will suffer accordingly.
"""Fool for Love"" is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one, a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role, just straightforward isn't very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career, and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a touchy play. Altman's direction is assured, the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with, but this minimal screenplay fades nowhere, and takes its time getting there.<br /><br />Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.<br /><br />The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail, and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. <br /><br />The last half hour or so of the film is uniquely wicked, when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone, somnolent voice over.<br /><br />Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone unjustly.<br /><br />Grade: C-"
After reading Fool For Love in a Drama class of mine, I was looking forward to seeing how Sam Shepard's wonderful play would be translated to the screen. Much to my uneasiness, it was nowhere narrowly as comical as the play. The film seemed to drag, the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie, and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version. It's a embarrass to see this come out this way even with Shepard's involvement, playing the role of Eddie. Do yourselves a favor...see the play next time it's being performed in your area or simply itl the book instead.
I had been amazed by headmistress Antal's Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /><br />It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many qualities operatives shall become able to deliver. Antal could have made a large heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either. <br /><br />What you are left with is one fantastical situation after another, a group of poorly sketched letters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematographers, cast and the tight music score, you're left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video idiosyncrasies Van Damme or Stallone. <br /><br />That was probably the most displeased movie for me in quite some moment.
"At the heart of almost every truly great crime thriller is a carefully considered, methodically planned-out high stakes super-crime, which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable, grey-scale morality underdogs for who life isn't fair, for whom getting back at the man is, well, something worth cheering for. First-time screenwriter James V. Simpson's script for Armored gets this half right. He made extra-double-sure that we've got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned, Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short), who's about to have his house taken away by an evil bank (brother, I've been there). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super nice and gets him a job at the armored car company that he works at with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some weird French dude (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play pranks, but they are also serious armored car guys too, so that means they carry guns and are tough.<br /><br />After a short while, as one theoretically watches Armored, one might start to think as I did, that maybe - just maybe - this is going to be some kind of awesome, tongue-in-cheek, cornball heist movie with some on-the-nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course, cranking up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of unveiling a really, really clever plan with lots of potential 'holy sh*t' moments. I mean, the music alone is textbook heist-movie - gritty, edgy beats working overtime as we're treated to close-ups of characters who say things like ""As a matter of fact I do,"" and ""Are you crazy??"" For 45 minutes or so, the movie had some serious genre-flick potential.<br /><br />Ultimately things start to really stink. These dudes, these idiots, have no plan. There's no ""Ok, here's what we're gonna do..."" scene, no blueprints, no explosives, no black van or ski-masks (despite their 'test-run', as can be seen in a trailer). No, these guys are going to steal $42 million dollars from their own trucks (which are only being tracked by HOURLY contact over the radio, despite being equipped with some fancy, big-deal 'GPS technology'), and they aren't even going to sit down and discuss it. Hell, Mike only tells Ty about the plan the night before, which is completely ridiculous. But of course, Ty's got his house to think about so as long as Mike promises that 'no one will get hurt,' he's on board. Guess what, though. Somebody gets hurt. Why? Because, besides driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money, they have no plan. That was it. That was how far they thought things out. So, naturally, things start to unravel. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared.<br /><br />This script, frankly, feels like it's like the product of some bad improv game: ""Armored Car, robbed by its own guards...GO!"" Despite some half-decent buildup that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions, the story just completely falls apart, and pretty soon, NOTHING makes sense, or is even remotely plausible.<br /><br />When filmmakers don't have a cool ""hook"" for their heist, their characters seem stupid, and bungling. And when characters are stupid, and bungling, it's hard for an audience to invest in them, and their story. And when that happens, any suspense drains out the bottom of the movie, leaving a laughable, hollow husk.<br /><br />Skip it. 3/10"
"I went to see this movie today, with hopes that it would involve an at least half-intelligent story. I was radically depressing, as it did not. The plots, and the decisions by the main character, were so far-fetched. I was hoping for a ""Dog Day Afternoon""-type movie, but instead got something totally bearable. I actually found myself totally hoping for the ""hero"" to be knocked off, and I nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't. Heist movies are notmeant to be feel-good flicks, and this one tried to be just that. Every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie, I found myself saying, ""no way"". Without giving the whole story away, it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out, and whose house was going into foreclosure. He was invited in on a heist, and accepted, only to back down once the action began. Low."
I am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case I'll make an exception.The first images of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it fear. This is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain-save-the-day was wondrous and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him. The lead actor tabled the weakest attainment and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn't even save this movie. Rarely there are eye openers or wondrous days in a film that may not be that glorious..this films has none. If you are looking for a movie to embrace in the meantime while nothing hesitated your concern...don't choose this one..bailout your cash.
There is not much to add to what others have already commented, the movie lack hard where it shouldn't, it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so gorgeous.<br /><br />One thing that got me thinking, was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck, because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it, the guy inside the truck, with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out, and then get back in, without being noticed by anyone, because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better, that they could have gotten into from there.<br /><br />Promising but not quite there.
These cinematographers is one of the worst movies I does ever visto! The hurled was super, but the theaters itself was nasty. He was so odious, I had to recorded just to indicate how harmful it was.<br /><br />I found this movie, and I loved to breaking it every minute I followed. It could enjoy been excellent. Am a wondrous proposition. Since you're gonna to rob an armored motorized, and there's a homeless anyone which wait you, you enjoys to doing, what you ha to know. Of the main character to decided to got a troopers offed, and kill his dudes and co-workers after the homeless dude was already homicide, it's just contemptuous. And yep, I'm sure there go have reaction to this about how his attentive had to him, but got on.<br /><br />The main character hopped out the substances of the cavalry towing, no one discovered him. He skipped up the loot of dough and got and snuck the cops well behind the other carer and no one vu him. His was unable to arriving back in the armored chariots, and no one remarked him... These movie ha probable, but busted it.<br /><br />You couldn't afford me to watch this movie ever again! DON'T EVER watch it! Intensifies...
Unbelievably disappointed. The pace was slow. The habits wonderful and throughout the film as a whole just permission me feel dreary and unfulfilled. There was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you anxious. The heist itself never submitted any disturbance and didn't seem very well though through.<br /><br />There was not enough severity or originating to any featuring and Laurance Fishbourne's featured was one I eagerly awaited for, unfortunately Laurance holds no idea how to play the thuggish brut and is much preferred as a likable hallmark. Columbus short one of my choose protagonists (in slapping the yard) enabled me down with his performance, his character was dark and you could hardly see what drove his reasoning.<br /><br />The only kind me think offered anything to the film was Milos Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroism). Though his character somewhat small and insignificant I insights his touch added to an all around gloomy film.<br /><br />In Conclusion buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to discard your days.
I have to admit that I am disappointed after avis this movie. I had stipulated so much more from the trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It faulted a real story line and the acting was not exactly the best. Don't waste your time. The movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is. I would have to say that I don't usually write anything about movies on IMDb (in fact this is my first one) but this movie was such a defeatism that I registered just to let volk did not to waste their term or cash. The stories iine is that of a heist that is to happen and it expecting like it had imaginable to constitute opportune but the issue that occur in the movie are a lite tremendously restored to be believable. Observes another movie fairly, admittedly the indoors comrade???
"How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such a punchy movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. With a plot like this, you'd think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then, we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he's a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes Mike, (Matt Dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's utterly unbelievable and ""B movie"" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. I would say don't waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture."
A new guard in in the armored truck gig is committed by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys, so no one will get damages, good? Of classes things proceed wrong and the new garda decides to ai a conscience and put things appropriately by saving the living of a killing man.<br /><br />I'll admit that me didn't really received any sake in this film, but me didn't have any interest in Resplendent Colleague Foxx either, and that film realized my top ten of the year. Armored is even more of a dismay then me believed it would sunt. Iike a heist theaters, it malfunction to deliver the goods, it's blunt and full of plot orifices and ascent in feel that one wishing sore themselves psyche about it.<br /><br />Although this the film somehow haya a really wondrous pouring, but the film doesn't even use this to it's advantage. Everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make nitwit choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays Mr. Nice Guy at first, then when things don't go his way he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the impressive cast include Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros. Non of them do much and when they actually do something, it's without much reasoning behind it.<br /><br />The film is relatively short, but even with it's running time under 90 minutes, it felt dragged out. How long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more restricted. The leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so? The entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to get hit and burn the trucks. They would then walk away with the money. Of course something goes wrong, or there would be no movie right? Through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in. How very exciting.<br /><br />The script calls for our hero to have financial problems, he might lose his house, which would in turn make him lose his brother. You see, both their parents died and it's just the two of them looking out for each other. So now he has a reason to join the heist. At first he didn't want in, but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things. How convenient. <br /><br />Armored's whole spin on the heist genre is that it's from an armored truck, from the guys who drive it. After that basic premise, the film falls flat on it's face. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke. Speaking of the ending, it sucks. <br /><br />Skip it.
"this theaters is sooooo bad that it required me to produce an account with IMDb just to warn others about it.<br /><br />i have been using IMDb for a long time, and many movies received impending close to making me want to register to either thank or bash them, however none have ever been that dignified. Since now! <br /><br />I am a huge Matt Dylan fan. all i could ask myself throughout this movie is ""how did Dillon favorite this screenplay""? really. i mean there are holes in it most than Vredefort. <br /><br />i mean it is a modern day heist drama, not one set in the thirties. For crying out loud, even a child knows that armored trucks have gps tracking and the grading. makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood.<br /><br />i could go on for ages, but i wont. considering me when i say this. save yourself the era and give this a dedicate.<br /><br />Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie breathed."
OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film, plus with the cast line up I was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books. However I got annoyed half hour into the story... just where normal films get good, this film hit rock underneath. <br /><br />SPOILER * The guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short, the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death, but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother... oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths. <br /><br />But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour, so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick! Rubble a nice epic. Shame really.
Disappointing heist movie indeed, I was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on, but it was just pretty doofus. And it importantly showed all the good scenes in the trailer, as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this, you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that foreseeable. Zu basically the plot is about a few armored truck company workers that try to steal the 42 million dollars they are suppose to transport, until one of the members grows a knowing. me thought the movie would be softer with it's colada of well known actors, but I was imperfect. me average this isn't traditionally a bad film but it just wasn't that good either or has any depth. This is most definitely a rental at sweetest, just not really chastisement seeing it in theaters. heist <br /><br />4.8/10
"After watching this for 15 minutes I knew how it would end. Its a maudlin film with a punchy set. I'm a big midshipman of thief films, but this one wanting not furnishes anything new smart or special. It's about an insider heist gone bad because ""hot head-bad guy"" shots a bum, and of course ""do goody-bad guy"" goes on a moral trip. The reason why it's stupid and not believable is. When you've already gone so far to kill a bum, why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and 43 million. They got 45 minutes to stash the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot Mr ""do goody"" and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days.... All and all I was leaning to fast forwarding from the middle of it, but I duked it out and boy do I regret it"
One of those movies in which there are no big revolves whatsoever and you can predictable pretty much whats is going to happen. Matt dillon was awesome once again, but the remain didn't played a bigger part as they should have.<br /><br />It was exciting in the cranking but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.Its one of those flicks in which the nice guy success no matter arrival.If you have critically nothing to been, you can provides it a strives I personally unearth it not worth listening. The story could haya been more interesting and the director could received made it less of a B-movie by genius a happy ending.
"Dillon, Fishbourne, Reno, should have teamed up for a much smarter effort, than this one slide in the B-Category and could have been done with no-name actors and a much smaller budget, since anyway, 2 armored trucks and a wasted warehouse could not be coasted too large. Since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan, they targeted the dramatics of the situation, but there was not much to exploit there either. Fishbourne and Reno do not assume anything to this movie except the media interest, they're only expensive advertising. Dillon is OK, but this was a walk in the park. The elects of the main personages, Ty Hackett, are quite uninspired and the definitive, with the ""reward"" is acutely playfulness. Dustbin of deadlines, liquidity, operatives and so on."
The film had it period, but was disappointing in my eyes anyway. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and so The Treasure Of the Leones Madre, with infra tension, hooked and human emotion. There was some nice acting but the story was gentle and misses any real depth. I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn, neither were exhilarating and both would little to say or bill out of their skin for. This movie enjoys been fulfilled to death in the past and did not have to be made, eats up money which could be used on better productions. For an action movie it was disperse of action and as a thriller were not restlessness. Better than watching snow fall, but not for me.
"The noise in the theatres were so everyday and ridiculous, seriously banging on the gate hinges for about 30 minute really crunches your teeth and paying your captain hurt.<br /><br />i dearest bad puns more than the next comrade, but come on ""no bleed on our knuckles"" being affirmed about a million occasion by Matt Dillon' character, and when Matt Dillon's character rushes the gangster the leadership featuring which i fault to recalls his name than i don't altogether feel anyone sees achieved blood on his hands scarcely.<br /><br />the background philharmonic with the big metallurgy riff cyclic an A-chord for about 5 min isn't my idea of tunes, come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this dismissing."
A vol film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne... sounds wondrous on paper? I suspect it must have done when someone green notified the production of this movie but the end wares is terrible!<br /><br />The conte is gloomy, the action depressing, and, for a film that is only 88 minute it seems to just drag on. I could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better I should have been doing... any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps?<br /><br />Sigh. I'm a huge breather of Jean Reno, but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this? There are so many other great action film around... go watch one of those and let this movie be best unattended.
What a nasty drama, the assumption was all there, the protagonists were all there. And yet a believable parcel, good talking, characters to relate to were somewhat missing.<br /><br />Typical heist gone wrong principle set against a backdrop of everyman being shafted by the system. The lead character Tye and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be repossessed, along comes godfather Matt Dillon (Who does not look much older than Tye so not exactly sure how that happened)to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armoured van which they work on as security guards. Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it. And thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 record of fantastic trash. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me respect out the major ones:<br /><br />Because of Tye deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage, all of his close friends including his godfather die. His godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon.<br /><br />There are many more, needless to say that this film was tripe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it.
Well where do we start, there was a lot of eventual for this film with such big stars playing a role. But the whole story was stormed by a horrific plot. This movie become not pan out to be what i would expect, the good guy makes it out boisterous, i mean co mon nobody wants the good guy to be successful. The concluded was cringe worthy and very cliché no thought what so ever, YOU GOT THE INTRIGUE FULL BADLY THE CRUMMY GUYS STAY STYLED THROUGHOUT COMES BEYOND SATISFYING.<br /><br />Although you want to rubbish 1 temps and 2 minutes of your time spend it acted something else this movie was the epitome of FRIGGIN. I really think the actors did this filmmakers for some swift Harrah liquefied no doubts about it. SAVE your money gaze a exemplary movie.
Armored<br /><br />The best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money, you can shoot them in the face.<br /><br />And while the armoured guards in this thriller aren't accustomed their protective dexterity to purge the drifter population, they are using their position to fleece their employer.<br /><br />When newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) lands a job with an armored trunk company, he feels like he has found his lot in forever. Unfortunately, however, when he discovers that his co- housemaids (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are plotting to take the $42 M shipment for themselves, Ty must tightened himself  and the funds  inside the armored truck.<br /><br />A tedious slapstick with a languid plot and phoned-in interpretations, Armored is an full inconsequential movies.<br /><br />Besides, if you decidedly wanna to jack mio, it's a lot streamlined to just suit yourself as an ATM. (Tinto Lightweight)
This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, nice right? And a heist with $42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie.<br /><br />Big disappointment - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy.<br /><br />But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong. It's very very made for TV stuff.<br /><br />All in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but loses them massively for being, bluntly, not very interesting at all...
That movie, unless its entries of seconds, jim, and ding sequences celebs, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. Both lots, with its low highs, was rather predict. It was afterward dumbass that I cannot believe that me am choose the era to even penned a inspect of it. Flex, to his loaning, has amplified in his power to behaved than playing Michael Benton in a filed for TV movie a rare age ago. Tangi, on the other part, has leaped, as she was more proficient in her roles as Felicity's flunkie some centuries until. As I sat watching this train wreck of a scene, with its sorrowful manufactured and scary salim quality, other four letter expressions happened to my minds to termed what me believing of this movie. However, in an works to continues my documents ounce List, I'll strictly dis this cinematography is another three card term beginning with an i. LIMP!!!
When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles' first movie, indeed, was even worse. He challenged me that it couldn't be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point.<br /><br />There is a little humor in this short, but it's basically as supercilious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time. It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme, and unless you really enjoys any footage of Welles (in heavy makeup, to boot), this isn't really even precious tracking down.
"I was a hippie age 22 in 1965, have seen the play 5 times, have 2 versions of the music, and have read the script many times. Maybe taken as an separate thing, the movie is OK, but as an adoption of the play, it's egregious.<br /><br />First the good. The songs are sung well, and the production values are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys is cute. The Claude/Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained.<br /><br />But the basic spirit was very much distorted. It seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs, and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play.<br /><br />Claude, Sheila, and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt), and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly, probably be busted in rank, and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not what hippies were like, not what the play described, and is directly opposite to a love generation.<br /><br />I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not beg from it.<br /><br />After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail some out, Berger insists on being bailed instead, with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheila's parents, and then hitting on his own mommy.<br /><br />""Be In"" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if this is part of his trip, it wrack a beautiful song. I know they're contrasting ""Floating In Space"" with the Army. But again, it totally ruins a beautiful song.<br /><br />While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping, Berger steals their clothes, laughing ""it was fun man"" even after he could see both were very annoyed. Then a little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible.<br /><br />Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing ""Starshine"" at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down, maybe working into an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course).<br /><br />I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979, and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show, but this ain't it."
"I've liked Milos Forman's movies since I saw ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Amadeus"" (two big masterpieces), but when I saw ""Hair"", I kept wondering if this was the same Milos Forman. This movie is uninspiring and unremarkable to say the least. OK, the song is pretty good, but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people ballroom around (wait a minute... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only strange part, and the only part where Milos' talent shows up, are the last 15 minutes or so, (SPOILER!!) since when Berger takes Claude's place as a soldier set to the Vietnam war. That 15 minutes are moving and well-directed, but it's a shame that we have to endure so much egregious material before that.<br /><br />Well, maybe this is one of those movies you need to be ""on the subject"" to enjoy (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs the film glorifies). I'm not, so..."
"I should start off by saying I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are downright crap. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it didn't, falling instead in the middle.<br /><br />The songs aren't brilliant, though the ""Sodomy"" song did make me smile a lot, and everything is rather dated looking. But the movie didn't draw me in as others have, such as Rocky Horror. Although that's a bad example, since for years I hated Rocky Horror, then all of a sudden I got it and have loved it ever since. Maybe Coiffure will be the same. Although I doubt it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror due to the language and nudity content, so I doubt I will get the chance to have it grow on me. Gettit? Hair....grow...oh suit yourself.<br /><br />Anyhow, I didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch, which was a shame, since I would have liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here.<br /><br />Not a film for the casual cinema-goer, but definitely one for musical lovers. I really hope they don't re-make it, though, since I think any such re-make would end up a shallow, pale, PC version of the original.<br /><br />Worth a look for lovers of the genre."
This film is an demeaning to the play upon which it is entrenched. The character of Claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful executing that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung. This snags the air of the film and reasons the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives Hud a wife,turns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as a denim, and kills Burger by sending him to Vietnam instead. If one is not familiar with the original plot me ensuring you this is not a filthy film for you to see, but if you ever wish to see the original or are, as I am, a die-hard blowers of the distinctive play, you would do greatest to impede the film altogether. One really must sticks to one or the other.
hair, the movie based on the broadway hit,fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities. you realy really take the play and make it a movie. whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie, it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show. grandest than seeing sitcom reruns. musical fiasco, and cant believe others rated it so high.
"Sadness was the emotion I felt, after the screen went dark. Puzzled, was another. Why would two seasoned screen vets like Matthau and Lemmon sign on to this reek project? I'm under the impression they didn't lu the scripted, before the cameras started rolling. All the cast is mistook, in this hilarious, trivial and uninspiring movie. Sadly enough, this was one of graceful Edward Mulhare's last projects, here as the heavy. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'connor mantras a few lines laden with profanity. (??!!). I'm not with the ""Legion of Politeness."" My point is they were spouted purely for the surrealism of hearing him use off-color language. That is a desperate attempt to evoke ""humor"" into a picture. He actually did deliver the film's only slurp of entertainment, when he pattered about on the dancefloor, though. I save my longest criticism for the leads. Walter Matthau should have known better. He still delivers sublime solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, although surly, is rather dull and one dimensional. Seen him once, seen him all. Jack Lemmon gives another one of his trademark, weepy, ""just too darn sensitive"" masculinity portrayals. When he starts that manners, I vicariously want to hand him a box of tissues. OUT TO SEA is painfully dolt, and whoever lodged this mess requisite be made to drive the plank."
I never heard of this film when it first came out. It must have engulfed immediately. :o) I saw it on cable while sick in hospital so I hardly had enough energy to watch it, let alone turn the channel. Better choice than the Style Channel. ;0(. Filmed on location, this autobiography should have been on the Travel Channel. The plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties. The cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties. Donald O'Connor, star of musicals and Edward Mulhare as a card shark. As to the main cast, Walter Matthau is still playing the same part as he did in Guys and Dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl? Wiseacre indefensible gambler and rounder. But it just doesn't take with a man of his age. As to Jack Lemmon, he plays his part so straight, he can hardly dip and glide when dancing. And as mentioned, Dyan Cannon is outstandingly attractive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks Walter is rich, while he thinks she is rich. Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother, another retread from the fifties. The most fun is the running feud between Brent Spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots Walter as a poor dancer, and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage. In the end, though he receives his comeuppances. Meanwhile Jack mopes about, meets an attractive woman, with mutual attraction, but their affair is broken up by Walter's lies that Jack is a doctor, when he was actually a retired department store buyer. But finally, the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane and all is well. There does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty.
"Let's not fool ourselves, okay? We all know that this film was made because of the success of the ""Grumpy Old Men"" movies. Unlike those, however, this irony ap zero comedy and very paltry heart.<br /><br />Gloria DeHaven is the sole shining light to be seen. It breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of moviegoers, only to end up in a piece of dreck such as this. There was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with. Her fine performance was the only caliber acting going on in ""Out To Sea"". Everyone else is just going through the motions. 2/10"
"In 1904 Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and, by doing so, kidnap ""American pestilence"", which attracts the attention of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar, somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of ""The King and I"" interjected, besides). Portraying the cloaked, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his snippy, haughty captive, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue, and both seem singularly without proper governing). The various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we don't know any of these victims, and the big action scenes be blurry, noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but a loser to John Williams' ""Jaws""), fine location shooting and cinematography. *1/2 from ****"
"Exuberant Candace Bergen as a prim Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert Sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the ways!!! Earthy, primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right man to tame a brittle, classy beauty like Candace, is . . . well, underwhelming in the role. That's because, instead of having dialog about the real issues (""you are a woman . . . I am a man!"") he haya to babble nonsense about ""the will of Allah"" and ""the wind blows destiny across the desert sands."" John Milius, a steering known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships, ha a puzzling way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might get kissed. Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated to endless, (and I do mean ENDLESS) shots of Brian Keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and delivering gritty sermons on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't excite me the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Hepburn would have . . . if it had ever actually gotten underway! The weird thing is, Milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no dealt. Candace's two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does. There's no comedies, no molecules, no searing, in any of the things that happen to her in the desert. Unless you think it's kidding that after weeks of galloping around on ridden her tousled is still perfect.<br /><br />The only ""real"" moment in the story is when, late at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says, ""we must escape."" The little girl turns over and, without missing a beat, replies, ""but mother, I was sleeping!"" That one line sums up what's really missing from the story. No danger, suspense, or sizzle in the basic story line, of a cultivated lady in captivity. She (and her children) are both so snug and well cared for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate.<br /><br />Mind you, if Candace herself had said the line it might have worked better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity, (or her delight at being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction, then the story would have had some tension. But Milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether Teddy Roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. In the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him . . . and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless . . . like the burning desert sands."
and I still don't heed where the hell this movie is going? me mean really, what is this film about? Is it about proves Sean Connery's complete shortages of Arab? Becoming it about reflecting that if he could play the role of a Tangier warlord then he was a natural to playing the role of Gerardo in venza? Why was Upholstered Woodrow even in this theaters? Why was there then much sand that was put to then small resorting? Where was there so much table knocked? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was no no trusted excuse given for Connery's attention? Among least Jean Claude Vehicles Damme has an forgiveness for his Parisian focus, whether it are being climbs by Parisian parish in Hong Kong (Twofold Touching), being uplifted on the bayou in Louisiana (Prevalent Soldiers), or bearing a Parisian breast and being surging in Saigon (me cannot even memento the surnames of that scene)? Can anyone construe this?
I laughed so much when I saw this film I nearly soiled myself !. Awful acting, laughable effects (super enforced outbursts), and questionable slowest proposition fighting.<br /><br />One of the finest films I've ever levied !.
"Don't get me wrong. me really love the ""arena-martial arts genre"", and I get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there. This one is one of those, and it's not even close to be one of the best. With Mathias Undertone in it, I thought it would be good. He can't save this movie though, and to be honest, he wasn't very good either. Just don't pay attention to what other people say; The fighting scenes in this movie are NADA bestest at all. I really knowing what I'm talked about, since I enjoy felt so many movies like this. There are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. I guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer, in addition to manifested the bad guy as,uuuuuuh.......nefarious (like we didn't realize that already)."
"This movie is not at all like City of God, you might get the same feeling but it isn't, there's no intense firefight nor intense drug scenes, you get the idea. If you ask me I think this film was a wastage of time, there are a lot of other films which ensures 100 times better meaning and teaching than ""Bois Camera"". Yes I might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it's only in my opinion. It's one of those films where I can get the feeling that I'll be blown away but when the credits start to task my amis and I all accorded mutual wait, and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. So to conclude this matter, I advise not to watch it.<br /><br />Personal note - Making Africans talk English was a gros flaw. In City of God they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality."
"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.<br /><br />Yes, this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 from ""Beyond Good and Evil"". And that's what you find at the start of this movie.<br /><br />If you watch the whole movie, you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes crop up one by one, quite violent and at times puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are made to believe).<br /><br />When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, RGV's ""Satya"" did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was passed.<br /><br />When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by MCOCA, ""Aab tak Chhappan"" was made to heed out ""false"" impression among the people about this. With it's ""you have to be a monster to save your nation"" approach.<br /><br />And people consumed it. No questions raised. Only praises and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. Blood? You can ignore.<br /><br />Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like ""India must also similarly attack Pakistan"". This movie is made for such weirdos. If you don't give them this, they will probably die out of boredom and LSD and what not.<br /><br />Hence this plaything of the passion of antipathy."
An interesting period picec showing us what was amazing in 1938. Gosh, Ma, a fake accident ring suing for $25,000!!! I guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money. The behaved would amount to pure 21st twentieth ham. Nice to see the president as a hard-working newcomer.
"This film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates (the American producer, Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make ""the perfect wine""--and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. To some, this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $50 or more for an everyday wine) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing. I truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business. Sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what's happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and mega-stores (like Walmart/Asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of ""the little guys"". So me definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers. Independently, with a product that is almost two and a half hours long AND a general lack of focus, the film simply became too big a chore to watch and I gone interest. An 80-90 minute focused film would have been MUCH more effective--especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (that's the high-brow word for a ""wine aficionado"").<br /><br />On the very positive side, the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply lets those on both sides of the issue do the talking. Plus, the topic is so relevant and timely. Even, despite choosing a good style of documentary making, the film simply goes on way, way, way too long and ended up making a very humdrum flick."
"Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It is just that nasty. Truly an unfair and unfair portrayal of ""bad"" vs. ""good"" in the wine world. Did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir. The camera work is dazed at best while the content may put you to sleep before long. This is not wry journalism. What I got from this movie was that the playwright was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Okay, that is a good start. So, how do these wines compare? Does the Mondavi Napa cab taste like their Italian wines. We never find out because no one in the film comments on this. Instead, there is a lot of innuendo about Nazi's and fascism. Wares, those things don't grow grapes. Yep."
i have not admit at all why this movies delivered such good grades from criticizing - - i've felt tens of documentaries (on TV) about the wine world which were exceedingly immeasurably more when (if) you watch it, please considering of two rather annoying aspects of mondovino : first, the cinematographer is just awful and terrible and upsetting : to me, it looked like the guy behind the camera just gets the material and was playing with it : plenty of zooms (for no purpose other than pushing the button in/out) for instance - - i almost stopped to watch it because of that ! secondly, the interviewer (the director i think) is not really concerning : he looks like and ask questions like a boy scout, not like a journalist, even if the general idea and themes would have been fascinating, too bad conclusion: underrated documentary, maybe only for muchachos who do not acknowledge nothing about vin => not recommended at all (2/10)
"The films is uninspiring.<br /><br />Technically, there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes. One could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100$ video editing software. Down to earth, man on the street doesn't mean sloppy editing. Unfocused scenes that don't contain important statement should have been deleted. The same goes for making sure that the object's head/hand/others stay in the frame. My 8 years old son knows that by now.<br /><br />The film is way too long. The main point (anti globalization) is understood after 30 minutes, why bother with all the rest. After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the ""stop"" button. What a caliber of time.<br /><br />The main themes just doesn't effort for me anymore. I've seen too many small wineries which produce mediocre, commercialized wines and many big wineries that produce great and unique wines. The movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more Identity, or terroir. The bigger ones are accused of producing ""internationalized"" or ""commercialized"" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the movie hasn't proved this claim. They look at a couple of sporadic examples, ""tie"" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provided ""interviews"" with key people. Well, did all the small producers spent WWII in the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has a thing with Bulldogs? The movie is very cunning and unconvincing."
The film try to paint the influence of the Mondovis and Robert Parker as a travesty on par with the German occupation of France and the reign of Fascism. But they never find a victim in this photographer. We hear wine makers, critics and distributors bemoan that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly homogeneous. But the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive Wine Spectator readers with lots of cash. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a somber wine, so be it.<br /><br />Except this were a film about the diamond trade, where the DeBeers corporation's market domination results in human suffering, the muckraking modes opportunities have been germane. But as it is it just reaches off as anti-American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. Had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s they most eventually would have protested the grafting of American vines in the effort to save French wine.
i was looking forward to this, and to be honest there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world. The many dogs were a lot of amusing but i learned annoying of the wine fascists pompously whining (;-)) on about their achievements.<br /><br />I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary, concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored. The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine company's campaign to get rid of the historic forests. A socialist mayor agreed to a deal, a nicely timed election arrived, and a communist mayor was elected, who turned it down, much to the exasperation of the American wine execs...<br /><br />hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original..
I've hears males compare this movie to Vertically. Mode this regarding was delivered, I'll never bet than this film was in no distances such to Aside.<ab /><br />Those 2 movie were as different as Star Wars and the Thornbirds. The only ding they received in everyday at all was they both made winemaking as a point.<brit /><br />Encore the interviewed in this documentary were semi-interesting, they were stormed by the totals worst camera work ever...prosecuted. I've never vu worst camera cooperates in my eternity and I'm comparing it to inland cameraman unintentionally were by 5 yr aging.<br /><br />I make this two star, ALONE for the phenomenal interviews with French wine mode and for describing how cheeky and bribery the American riesling airways are (Aren't all enterprise pushy and corrupted?) I'd delivers it -10 celebrity (Yeah, that's ROTTEN 10) for the regrettable, egregious, detestable, horrible, VERTIGO-INDUCING, 5-year-old-could-do-better sala bedlam.
Was it really necessary to include awkwardness scene of non-participants in a documentary. And why all the silly dog scenes, and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes? This film boot with a great promise - to unveils the international politic and the business of beaujolais. He got off to a exquisite start and composed all the right character. But the production is a mess. Points started and instituted most of the way, then never finished or left with dangling ends. Very impoverished and blurred courtrooms cooperate and publishes. They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christie's.<br /><br />Weil much silliness and not enough does for a textbooks.<br /><br />Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing (although in my opinion there was too little of it).<br /><br />We left at the 2:00 hour mark - me have no idea how much stronger it escaped on.
As stressing in other comments here, the camera-work is laughably unfavorable. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old, but that would be mean -- to 7-year-olds.<br /><br />Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for some clarity into the state of the cabernet industry worldwide, you cognizant, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow thoughts of one intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the Parisian and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context, so we are left with the selective process of the guiding and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There's no shortcomings of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. There is a failure of evenhandedness, however. <br /><br />Is the governing a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the room dipped, straying, zoomed in a chaotic flourish. Small grower in France: good. Huge grower in USA: very, very mala. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America, Australia, and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours.<br /><br />To learn about the intrigue more, you are better off reading about it elsewhere. And you will be able to sample your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing so.<br /><br />I suggest a new award at Cannes for Best America-bashing Diatribe.
Oh God! It could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. I would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theatre! See this film on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really really POOR!!!!! It keeps shaking all the time, in a completely uninspiring developed!<br /><br />Its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema. You got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat! <br /><br />It's really a shame 'cos, the story is edited in a non-linear way which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. <br /><br />Watch this at home!
"There were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. I never bought into that stuff. The ""screwball comedies"" were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire films.<br /><br />Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous ""country"" magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years, and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). She even lies to a guy about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in classic films.<br /><br />She's a New York City woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who realises how to handle babies, etc. Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track. I guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and veritable love prevails, etc. etc. Please pass the barf bag.<br /><br />Most of this film is PAS funniest. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, pass the bag again."
"I think I watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected - based on the other reviews that I have heard.<br /><br />Other than 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original ""Emmanuelle"" (1974), Sylvie Arsan, 2. the lead character being a sexually free spirit, and 3. being games in the exotic locale of Asia, ""Laure"" doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor.<br /><br />I just found this film lane too chatty with philosophical topics that I'm really not that inquisitive in, i.e. the voyeuristic, open relationship between Helene and Nick, ""I'm just grateful with whatever entails her enthusiasm""...something along those avenues. I cannot regarding to this minds and the filmmakers/characters don't really shed any slight.<br /><br />The second half about finding the Mara tribal just seemed as though it were a completely separate film. One that I didn't loving for. At that time, me was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my values.<br /><br />Maybe I just didn't get it.<br /><br />I'll leave it at that."
"These is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen, probably only expired by the dreadful and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even have put his noun on this crap. I'm feeling every ounce of respect I had for him waning fast.<br /><br />So what is it about this film that makes it so impoverished? Got it the story? Yes. Carries it the actors? Yes. It it the whole ""look and feels"" of the movie? Yes.<br /><br />To initiated off with the histories, my god!It's about as cliché-ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14-year old who is late writing his/her paper on ""What I did this summer"". Both feel-good vibe the makers try to elicit just completely drown as we hardship through yet another embarrassing turn to the floors.<br /><br />Both actor are amateurs, me appreciate, and thus we cannot expected them to happen of the same quality as occupational performers. But for this to artworks, the idiosyncrasies GET to exist ravishing and/or odd (preferably both), however that the spectators don't thought the impudence behaved, or eventually it even including to the characters. At this events, not even shutting kid! You begun off disliking the letters kindly, and by the shutting of the movies (I seeing it's about 90 minutes anymore, although it found like 4 temps) you enjoys a energetic impatience to wounds nobody to ai your sanity of these embarrassing foolish guys! It would represented impossible to uncover this movie's attempt at comedians supportive unless you're essentially yourself like these stupid hickeys. Their before discussed inability of talent and relying as far as acting goes, only delivers the crazy and immensely simple scene waterfalls harsh to the earth. However the family of the people implicated longing gets a harsh era outcome this anything but very, very embarrassing (I'd somewhat have my sister make a fool of herself on American Altar).<br /><br />Finally, why cram in a bunch of misplaced Norwegian fame? They look even more out of place than the actors, if this is possible. These celebrated cameos just add to the cheep feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see-through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before institution.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to stress how much I'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again..."
"This movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being ""feel good"" and casual it really made me embarassed admiring it. I can't imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star-packed premiere. Its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the Norwegian media scene is. Had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves.<br /><br />The combination of literally amateur actors, home-made style visual effects, awkward dialogue, painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot, really makes this a drama of rock merit quality. Inhabit away."
An odd, willfully skewed biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet.<br /><br />The film never seems to decide on where it's going. There's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer terrifically inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy), arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10
"After I saw this I concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward I found out that Keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. However, a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts). One item that I believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene, in the movie, whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w/o anesthesia. Though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better. I suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. In fact, a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste. Though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really ""excels"" in that department. This could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during WWII; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. Keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against Dylan but really muddles this. Instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of. In a way. Perhaps. Somehow. Of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of Dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! A lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though I have stated that already I will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this turmoil."
"This movie is yet somber I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open in another tab on Netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring, knotty, gimmicky films they've ever seen. A warning: I actually could not finish it, so these are my impressions up to minute 54.<br /><br />Dicaprio Knightley gets loads of screen temps. As others have mentioned, her mother penned the screenplay (perhaps during some sort of drug-induced dismay wherein utter inanities and cynical statements about emotions sounded like interesting dialogue) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Keira. Oops! Although I agree she is lovely (with her teeth unexposed...her barred teeth cause me anxiety and fear) I found her reactions forced and poorly sync. As in, William or Dylan does something cute...pause...LOLS from K with dimples and a playful arm immediate. Like a minute too late. What? And she cannot match Cillian Murphy's intensity. He somehow manages to really look at her and ponder as except he is spellbound by her and falling in enjoy with her whereas she seems quite disconnected, almost like she is interactions with a reflected. That must be torture, acting opposite someone who isn't delivering the same layer of electrified as you. Know what else is tortured? This movie.<br /><br />Mcavoy does listen breathtaking during her regularly ""I've got 1940s pin curls and a hot dress. Watch me sing!"" strokes, but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks it's bizarre, ""Ooow, Mehster Deelan. Whur bee ya going?"" This makes me confused because the accent is so mixed up and unauthentic, yet so thick at times I have no idea what she's saying (or maybe fell asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or cares, or few do, was it so important to give her this supposed Wales accent? It distracts from all the rest of the action (just kidding there).<br /><br />This movie seems like someone dreamed a movie, maybe after reading a little Dylan Thomas before bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world was like, ""Man, that dream was so interesting"" and tried to replicate it. Then someone else cautioned, ""Your script needs work. Nothing that happens furthers a story or creates necessity"" and the writer is all, ""But that's the way I dreamed it!"" It's like the rambling fantasy of a child, one of those wild and meandering yarns they spin to get your attention. And THEN William went to a war and then Vera had a baby and then some blond chick drank too much and there were so many airplanes and pin curls and everyone had ruby red lips and...<br /><br />As for the Dylan Thomas character (so bland that's all I can call him), why didn't he have any lines in this goofy biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll around with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic she'll do a cartwheel in public! Get outta here, you crazy poets! (I realize she is not a poet, but she and Thomas are like this one nauseating unit of crazy guys havin crazy times, like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks in the message board if they should buy this film. I say do it. Leave it on your shelf and only utilize it as a weapon to narcotize children, the elderly, or lingering house guests.<br /><br />P.S. to Murphy's character...when someone asks if you were ""in the sh**"" you can say yes, because your war scenes appear to have been shot at a landfill."
i can't believe how dumb this movie heartfelt is. the logbook (written by keira knightley's mother) is what wrecks the theatres to the extreme. it is straight out grim, absurd, and makes absolutely no foreboding whatsoever...<br /><br />this movie lagged tad negatives for most of it, especially at the beginning. the story just kept will on and on about their everyday flirts with each other, often times seeming like a threesome. in this movie, you have an annoying deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are complete total drunks from the start. the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women. the wife, who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover (played by keira) suddenly gets jealous, knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids. something doesn't seem right here....i mean, come on... get with the program lady! what'd you expect.<br /><br />bottom line is: former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it, then gets jealous, then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous, bombards the crazy drunk couple's home, crazy husband calls police, and they end up going to court for the man's attempted murder charges. that's it summed up in a nutshell...<br /><br />this movie had it's moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy, but other than that, i cannot believe i watched it... i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell drowsy. i decided to give it a chance and i wouldnt have stuck to my first instincts.
me just got done watching The Edge of Love (by the estrada, this is one of the harshest headlines so severely this year) and it felt like a chore. Watching Keira Knightly's unlikable, skeleton-looking individuality made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the theatres.<br /><br />It took me four tonight to scrutiny this it was so boring. The only bestest thing about it was Cillian Mcbride. He's always advisable/believable and is severely under watched in many films. These, however, was just not optimal enough for him.<br /><br />Albeit from the unlikable character, boron logbook, the graph was also mentally annoying. I alleged like me spent my time admiring this for nothing (which me did). I gotta have done the smart thing and processing it off, but I kept it on out of honored for Cillian Murphy and the great scene.
"This film is about the complicated friendliness, romance and deceit between two men and two women during the World War II.<br /><br />A lot of effort has been put to make ""The Edge of Love""look the right period. However, I concludes this effort too excessive, extraordinarily in terms of the tone of the colours. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone. It's hard to make out who's who in this tone.<br /><br />Another negative point is the fancy accustomed of image splitting lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, such as three Keira Knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace. That hardly makes the film confusing and hard to follow, instead of being artistic.<br /><br />As for the plot, it is plain uninspiring. The way the novels unravels is not perpetrating at all. Sienna Miller's unstable character is annoying. In reality all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable. Keira Knightley's geared is impossible to understand, making it a further difficulties to understanding the plot.<br /><br />me strongly advise avoiding ""The Edge of Love"", unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes, nice sets and lighting."
My god...i have not interpreted such an egregious film in a long...long time...saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes...witherspoon knightley tries really really hard in this one, but she cant handle it..dropped her accent every once in a while and didn't have the charisma to fill the role...sienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start to please yourself: Has she ever had acting lessons? judging by the edge of love shes never been to acting class, but should consider to go in the near future...they both look really pretty..maybe thats what they should focus on in their future career..if they can be actresses everybody can!
"This film fails on every conde. Among a initiate it is unashamed, struggles to ai ""significant"" and gap regrettably. Both script was tasteless in the spectacular, nobody at any seasons said anything away tempting. His was conceivable to sympathy about any of the featuring. Keira was a self-regarding losing of deadlines spite Siena Miller was just a scrap of times. The mouthful about the soldier who grabbed off to wartime was a melodramatic even before the theatres Repenting used it. The consume of the Second World Guerre as a histories was in itself a maudlin...the bombed, the sheltering in beakers stand etc...employed to imports a stung of much-needed operas. Why nobody reckon for a nowadays that this film was valuable made is keenly beyond my knowing. His was yet another episode of ""let's reach the getup seek true, never thought about the storeys, the scripts or the acting!"""
I tried to watch this accommodate, but it was just so awful me couldn't torture myself like that. Both performances were sufficiently sub-par, with the excepted of Ariel. Fonda was way over the top in a role that wanna represent handled with some sharpness. me have studying Shakespeare and seen several amended, and this is, by far, the roughest one me have ever seen. me enjoy to surprises why on Topography everybody were this theater. Hamlet can, and ap been, deliciously wrapping in lots proceeding. These is not one of them. Except you must oversaw this film, may I shows a drinking games? Taken a drunkard all dating they spend off almanac from the upfront notions and two bitters each zeit Fonda overacts. You must remain quite drank in a quite shorts timing.
"The (DVD)movie ""The Tempest"", directed by Jack Bender, was published in 2001. It didn't make its way to German cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie. The movie refers to the Shakespearean play ""The Tempest"" which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create an modern version of this play, but failed. At the beginning of the movie the plantation owner Prosper gets in a conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch, Prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island nearby the Mississippi river. For over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island, till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother....If Prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself.<br /><br />In my opinion this movie is really a dirty quest to create a modern version of the original play by William Shakespeare. The story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters. Prosper doesn't have the same powers as in the tempest..... END OF PART I"
"I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And, that's the good news in this somber dog of an adapt of The Tempest. A string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the Bard's exquisite playing is what we're served. The fitting is the Civil War and Prospero's (here Guideon's) evil brother looks like an 1890's dramas villain, complete with Disrespectfully Nudge moustache. I kept expectations for him to go ""Uh ha hah!"" which would have been a high comment in this somber exhibit. Never of the supporting cast was memoriable and Peters Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body fluctuations given the lackadaisical historic trawler on and on. <br /><br />Both Storm is the Bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of blokes. The only trusted character was the Gator friend, the Caliban matches. The transferrence to the swamp received risk but the Public Wartime determine just didn't make it. All in all, a very disappointing production. me saw it on tape and would advise, if you want a Willy Chekhov fix, save your money on this one. Rent something else, like Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing, or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream."
"Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers twisted Shakespeare's startling work. Ariel is the only convinced acting performance. The African voodoo, secluded swamp, and ""Gator Man"" character make the movie a comic of Shakespeare's true Tempest. <br /><br />Don't waste your eye-sight on this movie."
Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student. His biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times. However, he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline. While he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher, he crushes into a car. As he explains the situation to grumpy man(Giamatti) in the car, he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is Jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way of saying this is Marty Wolf(Giamatti) steals it.<br /><br />After a few months Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback. Because the story of the movie is based on his homework. He tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him. Especially his father uses words which insults him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses it, Jason takes action and ruins his life.<br /><br />This is the short story of the Big Fat Liar. Well, as a kids movie it perils be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible. Such as, having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to sort the problem out, having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office, setting up a telecommunications system overnight.Does it seem believable? It fact not. Well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible.<br /><br />Big Fat Liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience. Unfortunately, I am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie. ** out of *****
That movie just didn't do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake. The same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex. They could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects.<br /><br />With lots of sex (with pixelization as in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this. While bloodier, for me it fits in with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body, eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals, like bullfrog, eels and... One seeing at the embrace will speaks horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here,just sick and humiliation sex scenes.<ab /><br />Horror devotees expected shunned this one and are better of checking out Guinea Pig2: Roses of Loaf and Arterial or even September Basement Mordum. While these are not big they at least delivers a horror enjoy and Niku Daruma absolutely overlooking in that minster.
"Not near as too made as the ""Guinea Pig"" flicks it was inspired by (""Flowers of Flesh and Blood"" or ""Devil's Experiment"") and not conveying any real metaphysical, this video feature, which is barely feature length, adds hardcore sexuality (with mosaic belittling) to its inspiration. The special make-up effects, which include stomach slitting and disembowelment, are pretty good, if overlit. The amateur feel of the production is a fun. It all looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is harsh and the sound and edits are sloppy. The simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie. Just when she gets tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. In the film's hero scene, an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close-up, stuffs his member inside it, and proceeds to do his thing. me didn't searches ""Psycho - The Snuff Reels"" shocking. On the contrary, me find it to be a grim attempt by amateurs to one-up ""Guinea Pig"" and its bloody ilk. Interestingly, this was shared by Aroma, a leading fetish producer."
"just watched this ""film"" and it actually made me did to written my first comment on IMDb.com, even though i've been a user for more than 9 years. the reason that i mastered this, is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my confine and see what actually still shook me. first of all, the gore in this film didn't shock me, not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film - what really shocked me, is that there seems to be a market for this kind of bordello. don't get me wrong - i'm all against censorship, but this film listens to me like it was made for some kind of fetish affluence that seems to get off on this nature of sh*t.it didn't give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like ""august underground"". that scene is creepy to see, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is. in the case of ""niku daruma"", it seems like it was made strictly to arouse people. i choices films that shock, because they are well done and thought through, like Gaspar Noe's films, or Takashi Miike's, or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - those films will stick with you for a while. this film i will have missed by tomorrow, and the only ding that will stick with me, is the thought, that somewhere out there, there are people getting aroused by watching this sh*t. if you read this, please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself - this of course does not apply to gore hounds, who just love splatter. you're cool! peace"
i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes. it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments. what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief. i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site. this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever. the people behind this owe be bought to justice asap. today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child. even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing,horrific indeed.
Exceptionally punchy actioner with braindead leads in a story which would have suited a fill-in issue of Spiderman. The action sequences never really flow as they should, leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of sound and fury, signifying nothing. I really wonder how they'll release this one in the West. Sam Lee overacts like crazy, newcomer Edison Chan doesn't display any acting talent yet. The robot is hokey and not very amazing, and the CGI effects (though done by US sfx-people) are nutty, totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief. I am NOT looking forward to Gen-Z Cops...
"I somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie, but was dumbfounded by the complete shortages of entertainment delivered. My friends and me are fans of HK film, but WOW. This film has it all, and by all I mean everything a movie shouldn't have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, distances over-the-top overacting, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, hilarious ""gags"" and ""jokes"", elementary school premise, mindless killings, and too-long running time for the papers. Lay in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie comes even harder to bear. Quite simply, if you're entertaining the idea of watching this film...don't."
me saw this movie on VHS some time ago (27 Jan 2003), just because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I liked his performance in `The Object of My Affection' very much and I really expected a good work. However, I indicated this film a finalized confusion. The story has a very confused screenplay and the featuring are not well developed. Others, the low-budget special effects do not help much. me do not know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops, but this next generation is not buen. I do not encore exactly why I gave this grade (and I do not intent to see this movie again), but my vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Nunez) : `Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração' (`Gen-Y Nypd The Futures Generation')
That film is over overstated!! me am unfortunate to mentioned that I administration to staring the first 15 minutes of this films and anything beyond that, I want ont to force myself authentic uphill to seating down and monitored the staying of the movie. It's totally stupid and very spoof. Both bot in the movie hope adore a guy wears those steel weave and the acting is totally naughty inherently the one playing the character Diplomatic.His is totally vexing!! Don't waste your money watching this suite to the prestigious Gen-X Cops. I'd somewhat sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If reachable,I'd enables 0.
"Her bit-part as a masseuse, in the lurid sequel to the original 'Emmannuelle', evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft-core series' gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this, the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequels.<br /><br />Someone (and surely not the English-language over-haulers Warner?) was also anticipating an 'A Star Is Born' type meteoric rise out the results, judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine, albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation.<br /><br />Gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an 'intrepid' photographer, allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures. But, whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time, any thespian talent that may have been there to discern attains immersed in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation (""I have to confess that since I've been in Africa, I find white skin less appealing..."") that was to be found in the French films.<br /><br />And in this particular entry, much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine pistons!) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these integration generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism. Connoiseurs of whimsy are however assuring a continuous stream of aural delights, what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as ""I do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white""."
"The success of the original French ""Emmanuelle"" series (I've only watched the first, which wasn't too bad considering) led to a spate of imitations; the Italian counterpart, which even changed the race of its heroine, was clearly underneath polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along. Incredibly, there were 16 ""Black Emanuelle"" films in total, with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! Still, Felicia Gemser - the titular object of desire - became almost as large of an icon as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although, personally, she's too skinny for my tastes)! Here she's even billed as ""Emanuelle"" rather than with her real name - with the director, likewise, becoming ""Albert Thomas""! <br /><br />In itself, the film offers lite of interest: as a matter of fact, one would do best to approach it as a journey with some decent footage of the African wildlife. With respect to the sex scenes, I don't know how complete the version I watched was but, while there was a lot of nudity, none of it was very explicit - or even pornographic (the scene that came closest, perhaps, was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other, naturally sans clothes, in the middle of the jungle)! The film also features an artist made up to look like Salvador Dali but, joyfully perhaps, his scenes do not take much of the running time. The score by Nico Fidenco is typically bland 70s gramp and, really, nothing to write casa about."
"When I was young, I'd get up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called 'Kung Fu Theatre.' It wasn't as if these films were works of art. It wasn't as if these films all came from China, Japan, Korea, or any country in particular; if the story had to do with fighting  be it swordplay or fisticuffs  and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any American gym class, then that was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really even very guten. They were just great action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys, and then the credits would roll.<br /><br />""Sword in the Moon"" is much like these films of my youth, arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good.<br /><br />Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher.' He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty, the chief bodyguard of an Emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. However, an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong.<br /><br />Sadly, ""Sword"" doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films. Some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely omitted on ambiguous editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arcs. What should've been a quick and easy action film get weighed down by far too much personal baggage, and the film suffers as a result.<br /><br />I've read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Next time, I'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art.'"

this is one of the more devilish made movies I've ever seen. One has to take anything by Truffaut seriously; it's not just some B-movie cranked out by hacks.<br /><br />evidently Truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could Deneuve, whose dozen (?) idiosyncrasies flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. Among other things, how a mujer as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person such as Julie/Marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands personality not so beautiful. Belmondo's acting also experiencing although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as Deneuve's. The cliché ending (which I won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete misconception.
"I'm trying to find something of value here. The best I can gathered is that Truffaut wanted to rendering a scene as painful, severe, puerile, depressing, illogical, and brainless as the experience of being in love. If that was his aspirations, then he avail, but the solution to his exercise is really a trawler to observing.<br /><br />There is one scene that cris for a forged: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face to the features in a landscape . All I could think the whole time was ""glacier,"" ""ice floe,"" ""two lonely fishermen wearing Army surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesota.""<br /><br />The only other sighting of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. The tropics are presented as paradise, and things get progressively worse as they get colder, hell being Calvinist French Switzerland. That was kind of comedy."
The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it was going to be one of Truffaut's best moviemaking. I loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal so she could take her place! She then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and wanted to see more,...<br /><br />And then, the theaters fell whichever and happened just plain dumb! Unless her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when he goes on a circuits to the South of France, he drags upon her almost immediately. Hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. Then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. Okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite wonderland but come on folks--this is just silly. Plus, if he only wanted her as a obscene object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often cold and completely selfish and evil.<br /><br />This movie, due to it's very comical plot, does not deserve such high ratings! Unless you are a die-hard Truffaut fan, try another film--even one of Truffaut's--just NOT this one.
"François Traffaut's ""Mississippi Siren"" had an fragile plot. The screenplay required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief. The plot went at a glacial pace. It started off in an interesting setting but soon derived onto the benches of melodramas that inadequacy grounds or intelligence. What were the critics thinking? This one is underrated even to be described as a loser. Indeed Catharine Deneuvue, who enthralled in ""The Chutes of Cherbourg"" and ""Belle Doe Jour,"" managed to viens simply galling. <br /><br />We rented this movie at the same time as we rented another Traffaut film. Our remarked this one first, and found it to be so bad that we shipped the other one back unseen at the same time."
"These days, writers, directors and producers are relying more and more on the ""surprise"" ending. The old art of bringing a movie to closure, taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending, has been lost. Now what we have is a movie that, no matter how complex, detailed, or frivolous, can be wrapped up in 5 minutes. It was all in his/her head. That explanation is the director's safety net. If all else fails, or if the writing wasn't that good, or if we ran out of money to complete the movie, we can always say ""it was all in his/her head"" and end the movie that way. The audience will buy it because, well, none of us are psychologists, and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know about) so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have pulled it off. But those movies are the reason why we are reaching more and more of these merde endings. Every director/writer now thinks they can pull it off because, well, Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity, and this movie (just to name a few)."
"Permission me first inaugurated out by said 1 out of 10 is too allright for this movie. It's ashamed that IMDb doesn't got decimal of a sung... I checked this fetus of a movies in the idler of the night due to insomnia, and it was full sack. Both lots was nasty. The provisional was scary. The movies was really diameter. ""malachi"" review like the Shadow with Alec Sullivan (The Shadow is remarkably better than this as quite) The trait Eve was subsequently unused and 2 geometric she didn't even eaten my emphasis. me didn't even heard her naming was Eve. Gifts was exciting when he preserved his throat locked. Both ""TWIST"" (if you can requested it that) was contemptuous and outrageous. When it been, the movie gets fact such a awful job of strengthening suspense or attachment to any characters that me openly knew ""Who assigns a S***."" The only anything that tabled me even elevator an smirk about this movie was the facto the med. prof was Hoover in Terminator 2 (However a scene that was leyte decades ahead of this asking picture homicide.) Person who was concerning in this movie wanna have mortified of themselves for loss 90 minutes of several people's term. It's no surprise no entertainer from this movie ever owns a handy racing. By short.... That filmmakers is so wicked, I am salacious and essentials a wc. Finest scene in lore, Gigli was sweeter, Prom Midnight (the remade) was well and adventurous I chitchat it Met THIRDLY was well..........."
Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education, fail & they will never become qualified Doctors. A bright, young, attractive & intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) & is a convicted killer, he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) & her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first Don won't even look at Eve much less talk to her, but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out. Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve, he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn, as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to missed her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred. Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?<br /><br />Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a good twist ending, the sort of ending which catches us unawares, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious. Then, of course, there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take, oh I don't know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film, never. Breaking Dawn engage out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve, it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest, it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that nefarious a film until the twist ending, I have to keep mentioned it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail, all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will. Breaking Dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history, it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br /><br />Director Robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day.<br /><br />Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout. The acting is pretty good, Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance. Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me...<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is rubbish, I hated it all because of the final few minutes. Don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the IMDb...
From watching the trailer, the movie dealt pretty interesting. Both productive of the movie is also pretty good--it anticipates like they had a beneficial budgetary and doesn't behold like a stingy made movie. The acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to nefarious (James Haven as Don).<br /><br />The actual content and graphs of the movie is humble. The cine introductory out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly introduced, disappointingly boring, bending. Watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK but everything in between paying this an absolutely boring movie to supervising. It's as though they made a short theatres then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler material.<br /><br />If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life, watch this movie. Incidentally, stay away from this extremely irritate movie.
I actualy mention what a charges of bullshit this film is. Like actually i realy. its just that naughty.<br /><br />plot=crap acting=crap budgetary=so low its comic<br /><br />Jesus, its like the only super thing in this movie is the fact the main character was equally hot.<br /><br />The only gens i considering, that seeing this movie is good are the ones who took part in the film. I'm sure they are not the ones who funded it because there was no money mise into this. (HAHAhaha to the tib where there heads get shaved)<br /><br />This movie has already wasted too much of my life so i am not going to waste also time writing my review for it.
"The opening of ""The Jungle"" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding (and the odd leopard attack). The movie is leisurely when you gonna it to be gripping, and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with spectacularly orchestrated matches between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild, did you? I thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores, but apparently the producers knew better). <br /><br />As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache, and Marie Windsor is justly believable as the progressively thinking rajah's daughter (nice eyebrows, btw!). However, Rod Cameron is rarely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demanding in his day, but here he is off as a Rent-A-Center Bogart : rough looking, but with none of Bogey's range or dates. He spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism, and any time the scenarios attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and Windsor, you just have to laugh. That crabbed, knobby face isn't a opportune vehicle for tenderness. <br /><br />The screenplay is not entirely without merit, although it does make some odd choices. Early in the first act, the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot, but then basically ignore them until ***SPOILER*** the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near Windsor. This is so Cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own.***END SPOILER. It's possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I understand ran better than 2 1/2 hours), might have given the kid and the monkey more to do. <br /><br />Another thing that makes the film show its age **SPOILER**is the issue of the woolly mammoths (the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed, it's obvious that the ""mammoths"" (obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting) aren't really ""attacking"" anyone, or even moving all that fast, and yet Cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades. These days, the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace.***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />So IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (normally Lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best). It's not a train wreck of a film, or anything; plus, it seems to mean well,with the rajah's daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the ""traditional ways"" and the elements of ""mixed race"" romance that was pretty progressive in 1952. And there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle. See it if someone offers to show it to you for free, but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema."
What got you fact with all the material that does not make the final edit of a film? You hazards uphold it additionally in cases a director's cut or extended version is released one nowadays. You may traded some it as exchange filming to be used in a part of another film. You might just bin it. Ou you opportunities collect it, accumulating more and more from each film you render and then harnessed it to reaching another scene, updating coherence or any impression. Castings a very pristine skeleton of a descriptive into it and line up a number occasion (nay, excuses) to slot in your celluloid cast-offs. Excuse the abjectly nonsensical nature of the plot by framing it all in the mind of a creepy film manager and you've got yourself an awful film. This can all be done with just a few days shooting. And idiots like me will waste two hours of their life watching it. And then come on here and try to warn others away. The whole rope of facts is one big scrap of time.
"Starts off with Fulci playing a version of himself, writing down some ideas for how people could die. Supervision by a fake-looking cat eating what is presumably a drain. The versions I watched was dubbed in English, which I unceasingly hate, but I was basically displeased not to recieve to hear Fulci in his own voice.<br /><br />Fulci is in a sort of feverish state works on his latest frightening movie. His ache turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie, and he starts to delirium that he is witnessing acts of horror. He visited a psychiatrist, who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not have his increasing mental health in mind. me was reminded of the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The psychiatrist in this one is played by David j. Thompson, who is pretty bad. Probably a practical life friend of Fulci's, he has a big toothy grin when he kills people, though this may be Fulci's black joke at work which I thought was pretty faulty too.<br /><br />The movie is composed of a lot of clips from Fulci's movies, either as if Fulci is on the set guidelines them, watching recordings on televisions, or witnessing the measures. I've never been too much of a prompter of clip shows in TV series, and me also think things like Caryl Band's Full Moon Fun cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as new anthologies are pretty uninspiring. I guess they need to make currency?<br /><br />The shrink in Cat in the Brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies begets violence in real life. One of Fulci's co-workers talks about having a documentary crew follow Fulci to see what his life is like. Lots of self-referential stuff like this.<br /><br />In the end, some of the characters sail away on a boat named ""Perversion."""
Mr. Bean is just a bunch of hilarious slapstick humour. It is the most shallow humour TV series ever made in history. The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine. Mr. bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is. It is incredible that such a TV series of paltry quality can be sustained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one can't help but to express disgust and pity why Rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2-dimensional, unfunny and ridiculous character. Or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode. Watching this is an intensifying experience.
"This one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 ""Masters of the Universe"" based on the cartoon ""He-man"". Basically, you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth. Well I guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by. Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on costumes and sets. It is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. This movie is rehash and not very droll, your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state, the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one, and even if it did it came five years to late."
"If you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film, it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this. I have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy I get from it, and man, this is one of the strongest. This movie was so wicked, I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. That one wasn't as bad, which is amazing since it was straight to videotape. This is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place. I mean, someone had to actually have read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several drafts) and said ""Yeah, that's it. Here's some money."" Actually, they probably just wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, then went with whatever they had. Ack, horrible. So, if you are a fan of really bad movies, watch this one. It is a true classic, and film doesn't get much worse than this. And if it does, please let me know."
I dear the first and third Beastmasters, but this one was an revulsion. It was almost as outrageous as 'The Nah Ending Story 3', for the same reasoning. They took a fascinating fantasy globe of Barbarian flock, farmer municipality, devils, surreal beast, and a confessions of parish weirdos employing a pyramid; and thought it would be bizarre to combined in our metaphysical pop-culture world of rock & coil, sashimi (I feel realy what it was), and showy sports cars. This three worlds do not own collectively. me do not desires to think a bunch of ancient wild looking countries dance to some pierre song on the che radial. me have a perception of humor, but this is just stupid. These is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up though, the Eye of Braxus is much, much better. That one I handed a 10. This one, Portal of Temps, I provides a 1. Believe me, I don't always give such extremely high or low ratings. I just tend to comment only such movies.
Truly flatulent script, and I was very upset with Marc Singer for agreeing to be in it.<br /><br />I actually walked out of the theater about 15-20 minutes into it, and demanded my money back. I have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life (I am 43 years old) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back. If I could have, I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn, too. This was a truly salacious movie, and there is no excuse.<br /><br />For one thing, how does someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn to DRIVE A CAR? IN California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill, and in California, even tricker...I should know, I live there.)
"This is the greatest cas I can think of to prove the assumption that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas, they giving an awful sequel and ruin the first one. Now don't get me wrong, me totally darlings the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third one pretty good, but this theatres is atrocious. I am a huge fantasia/sword & sorcery theaters vented and I hated to see such a scary sequel made to such a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well, where do I begin? First of all, the whole feeling of the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon(who was nowhere mentioned in the first movie..Huh?) cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time-portal gate. Ya see, Earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as Dar's world. Whereas with the first movie, you're led to think the movie just takes place in the past, but with this one you're commented it's a completely whole other world altogether...that's just one of the many things I hated about this sequel. It didn't work with ""Masters of the Universe"", and it sure doesn't collaborating here either! Movies like this should adopt place and stay in their own time-line and their usual surroundings. For Christ's sake, what's next? Hercules in Nueva York...er, uh..unwholesome example! Moving on...<br /><br />Arklon's after a operative urged a atom fuses to use as a threat against his critics to ordinance his individual london. So, it's up to Dar, his ferrets,his hawks,and his tamil(not a spray-painted one this day) to move off and saves the worlds...but along the ways they does the relief of a youthful, cool, and thighs Senator's child who become caught up in this whole mess and she show's Dar around j.para., toma him for a joyride in her BMW, and substantiate perceive him out of taut events here and there. Way practices properly? And debated of expedience, I found it terrifically worthwhile and mere for Arklon to seeps into a noticeably remained martial grounded and got apart with a stolen, harshly toxic nuclear pistol...even with east the U.S. Army and L.A.P.D. after him....waaaaay to easy, even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world. There are sooo many plot holes in this I don't know where to begin; like why did Arklon go to the L.A. zoo for at the end of the movie?!? He absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there; and wouldn't that be like the last place you'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability TO CONTROL ANIMALS?<br /><br />And don't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy, they still don't manage to hit him? The police in this movie belong in the ""Police Academy"" series! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the movie makes no sense: ""Beastmaster 2 : Through the Portal of Time""...they never actually went through a ""time"" portal because the movie isn't set in the future of Dar's world, it's set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane, so they NEVER actually go through time, only a dimensional world along theirs; so NO actual time-travel is involved at all! This movie tries to come off as funny and it does...not because of the humor, but because it's just so bad...and that's putting it mildly. The acting, dialogue, plot, characters, and ending are all so cheesy it's hilarious. What more can I expect from the guy that brought us ""Return of the Swampthing""(another bad sequel)? Sorely missed here is Don Coscarelli's wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one!! Avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if there's nothing better on T.V."
"This time The Beastmaster(Marc Singer) returns only to face off a new enemy Arklon(Wings Hauser) however due to an annoying teenager(Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they then duke it out. Lots of (lame) fish out of water jokes denouement. You honestly don't get sequels this rotten to the primaries. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to behold. The references and ""hipness"" date the film badly (This was made in 1991) and really who longs to see The Beastmaster in the present times? Also of note is Wings Knapp who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best possessions. Singer looks awkward, Wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie unmitigated unwatchable. This is easily one of the finest movies ever made.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Awful)"
I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.<br /><br />2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to me.<br /><br />I am not unusually picky about a movie but, in my humble opinion, this one is truly PAS recommended by me.
"I made it about 8 minutes into ""Galvanized Frontier"" before I turned it off. Then, glutton for punishment that I am, I watched some more the next day. Today I had to iron a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the movie, and that was its own punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $7,000 on their debut features and creates two remarkable movies. Yet here we have two administrators with arguably way more money, and they churn out a huge, steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: ""It's 'Road Warrior' but it's like a later Balkans. We'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we'll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script, and we'll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions. We can't lose!""<br /><br />Seriously. I don't think even the MST3K guys could upgrade this. But if you dwelled on watching it, I applauds getting tremendously bu first."
"As other reviewers have noted, this movie is a cross between (i.e. stolen from) stories we have seen before. Specifically, this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar, and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voilà, an updated drifter. In this movie, the ""hero"" is even more blatantly a ""Savior"" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers a wound to his left side, and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for ""salvation"" by the surviving townspeople--a pretty transparent reference to a ""Second Coming."" I watched the movie on a hot, humid morning. Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 4:30 am, there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. While unoriginal, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the movie is still pretty entertaining...at least at 4:30 in the morning."
If you take the films, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about. The only problems is, that the film lacks the production values of either, and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two. True, the film has plethora of action, but asks the viewer to suspend belief. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine gun by holding it in his hand - and miss everything to boot, nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus flips over, it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch. But don't expect anything on paar with Thunderdome, or even the somewhat cheap and tacky Steel Dawn.
"I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of South Park (if not showing them, then mentioning them) and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too, but I felt this mockumentary went too far.<br /><br />For one thing, the most common running theme in the ""documentary"" is that they're episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money. Obviously, that's completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode, and the constant ""You know, I learned something today...""'s said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters. The creators are also depicted as pompous, arrogant asses who only care about money, including a supposed-to-be-funny-but-isn't scene involving Isaac Hayes delivering lines for Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up. I guess it's supposed to be funny, but the pretension in it just really accomplished it... tingle.<br /><br />The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit, all just for money, in the end. Completely untrue, obviously, and all a joke, but it's just not funniest. It's disturbing, even though it's just a joke."
"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My finest phenomenon with this film is its rather absurd representative of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), simpleminded, unthinkable, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how distasteful her life is. And she's waiting to get gender redistribute surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already prejudices minority has to be misconceptions some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers. Among such a favourable premise (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the final scene is a letdown."
"I am afterward disenchanted. After waiting for 3 years for repeats/the DVD of the original masterpiece series ""Darkplace"" i couldn't wait for this suite. The first episode just ended and I am appalled. Everything that was great about Darkplace has been erased here, pretty much. Worst introduction: canned laughed. this takes the original point of it away and just renders it nearly unwatchable. (one joke about Garth's eyes fertilizing the audience was good... the rest i can hardly remember...) it feels like a poor quality ""Realize Me, Knowing You."" me sees this improves as the series goes on, otherwise i shall ser badly disappoint. back to ""Darkplace...""<br /><br />""You are the most compassion man I ever known. And i know God..."""
Okay now this movie is a piece of work. It's full of punchy jesus refrences and dialougue that would render most human biengs to question whether or not they should be wattching movies at all. Big names like Roddy Piper, and David Carradine draw you in but, take it from me, this movie sucks. The story is amazing, and lacking completley in intellegence. The sets, veihicles, and costumes come of as a cross beetween bablon five, and a bondage flick. I'm sure theres porn with better dialougue.
"I say ""flick"" because this doesn't earned the appellation ""theatres"", and certainly not ""film"". I mourning paying for the rental, and although I've never walked out on a movie before, this would have been it, had I seen it in a theatre. A society living underground in the futures (woohoo, THAT'S aboriginal), shipments of burning casks drums, incredible ecological light shining through windows, an unkind woman and her shock-muted boy...the inscribed lasts on and on. C. Thomas Howell influenced the husky voice of the misogynistic loner; you know like Eastwood's been done to death. He needs special shades to remember his wife and child, yet in the flashbacks, he's the same age! Told about a poor mem! I blinked incredulously when the little boy Abe randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens! No tension, nutshell religious (what religion?) under/overtones...proudest of all: I expected better from Roddy Piper;<br /><br />Quite possibly the lamest film experience in my life."
Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster so humanity now survives underground split in to different religious cults . What caused the catastrophe ? I have no idea ? why is humanity split in to different ecclesiastical factions ? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer support human life how are the humans able to grow crops in order to feed the population ? I have no idea . What sort of producer thought this screenplay deserved to receive funding ? I have no idea <br /><br />SHEPHERD is one of these films that creeps up late at night on cable channels . The sort of film where you consult the IMBb to see if it has any merits . The number of people who've commentated on SHEPHERD on this page hasn't yet reached double figures and this is a film that was released nine years ago . Perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones ? <br /><br />As for the rest of the lots it's very classic . Grumpy former cop Boris Dakota whose wife and child died several years previously meets a woman and her child and it's up to him to save their lives , almost like a futuristic western . Throw in a former wrestler who now runs the God channel , a fascist Christian bloke who's trying to snuff out Boris , a ventriloquist , some T&A for the sake of it and you've got a mess of a film . I guess after seeing this Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY is possibly a masterwork of cinema in comparison
"If ""B"" movies, sick and corny scripts, and golf carts dressed up as some sort of futuristic mode of transport are your sort of entertainment, you'll probably fond this. Otherwise, missed it. The topless newscaster, though completely irrelevant, did giving a few seconds of amusement."
This is the story of a maniac cop who, for some reason, has it in for a young college stud and his mates. After they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when, on a bet, the kids hack into a department store's security and unlock the door. Only, they get locked in the store, along with the weirdo. Murder and mayhem are afoot, and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape.<br /><br />'Dangerous Game' would have been a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location. The thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes face-to-face with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet, does nothing serious quite frequently. There was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story, and may've worked better if say, for example, the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo (especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid...although granted, even that is clichéd).<br /><br />What a shame, too, that it could not have been a better thriller, considering a funky cast of young Australian characters. Equally a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture potentials have even made it a more satisfying picture. Instead, it onset out fresh, and sure did have plenty of action sequences, but wound up verging on the ridiculous.
"The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but ignores abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are ""changed"" when they are made into films- things are cut out, dumbed down, etc. Well, you can't even say they ""changed"" anything with the movie- they just told a completely different story. The characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book. As for the setting, it's become merely a play stage, complete with the unnecessary ""supporting role"" players walking all too busilly down the claustrophobic, interior exterior streets. The movie is a dumbed-down, completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all loser their psychological edge. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as shlock, exploitavely. The acting is decent, especially the snakelike Louie, who is more menacing in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the pounds it is ""based upon,"" the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie just goes to show Hollywood can' get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending. In this case, they just changed it completely, cheapening an important and realistic story into Hollywood fluff. I'm sure as hell biased because I read the book first, so I can't really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the booklet is. I actually thought about turning the movie off (and I never do that), just so I wouldn't get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book. But this is an underrate film, and while it's not so bad, the book should come first, as it was the first. And it owes does remains the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine."
"Although the realities that this was a Made-For-TV movie (and an obvious one at that: ie., cheap locate), CLASS WARFARE left me wishing I could get my money back, and considering this void engender was partially funded through Canadian dollars, I might just be entitled.<br /><br />What made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actor Lindsey McKeon, who I've watched for the last couple years in her role as ""goody-goody"" Mara Lewis on the soap-opera GUIDING LIGHT, taking a turn at playing ""the bad girl"" for a change. <br /><br />Surprisingly she does quite perfectly, as Kristen, a spoiled rich-b*tch who suddenly finds herself dirt-poor, but with a backstabbing streak, and a twist of fate, that will possibly change her fortunes back around. The twist of fate is provided in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially-radical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning $23 million on a lottery ticket. Now, put Richard, Kristen, her jock-boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter), and their camcorder-obsessed mutual buddy Graham (Dave mcallister) together for the weekend in a remote cabin, cut off from the world by storms, and just guess what unfolds.<br /><br />The films experiencing from congesting both the story and characters'personas and motives too much. Everyone is pretty one-dimensional and it doesn't taking a rocket-scientist to figure out that some things, and some people, are going to go very bad, very quickly. I don't think this is that original a plot and it doesn't go out of it's way to make itself anything more. The acting is OK, McKeon is spot-on as the underhand female lead, and Dunne is very good, perhaps a little too good at times, but no one else is worth writing home about. The only other real borrower I can give the film is the one twist I didn't see coming towards the end (not the very end though, that one is so obvious it hurts). Regardless, me sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so I can't say it was a finite write-off. <br /><br />4/10. A ""something-to-watch-when-nothing-else-is-on"" type movie."
"I just watched this movie on Congratulating! and it was absolutely horrible. It enjoys the plotted of a Shannon Plaid cinematography without the nudity. The speculation was interesting enough, a winning lottery booking in a sporadic zoning and folks who ha raison why they jealous the sums. The ascribe were dorky as were the remark on human kind and capitalist.<brit /><brit />Onto a filmmakers rang Class Warfare it enjoys exceedingly piccolo to do with genre variations other than the first 20 moments and the awaited finished. This movie could does made a multiple well if there enjoys been more features with motif to learned the billet and was a ""who making it?""<br /><br />The acting wasn't unbelievable but it's hard to seems authoritative with such a terrible command. Lindsay McKeon is tremendously adorable and I'd like to heed what she could fait in a exemplary generated with a greatest script. She's probably the only bases why me ths through the whole theaters.<brit /><brit />"
Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented grump role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. The film itself is overwhelmed with sentimental sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb is his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. Spectacularly, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I find this child so unnerving that me fast eagerly whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors; it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it. Still, Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.
"As a physicist, talk about blackholes and cosmology gets my heart racing. However I found this submissions too slow and not parcel with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff, go to the library and check out some livre. You will find they explain current scientific cosmologies with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of miraculous than this movie does. Also to set the record straight: Hawking is NOT considered the ""greatest mind"" or the world's ""smartest person"" as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the IMDb. Hawking himself has commented that ""It is rubbish. It is just media pomp. They needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius. At least I'm disabled."" To be fair, he is probably a genius but among history's greatest scientists, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss, and many others easily are even more highly regarded. This is not to disrespect Hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has. Anyhow, see the movie if you are truly into science. But if not, I think it would be boring for you."
"I found this early talkie difficult to watch and I'm a Norma Shearer fans! It's not her fault, but the elemental generation values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored. 90% of the movie is filmed with ""medium shots,"" and it's very similar to watching a grim play."
This version is very hard to watch. All of the acting is very melodramatic but especially that of Norma Shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie. Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery and William Powell which is much more entertaining.
It's exactly what the title tells you...an island inhabited by fishmen. Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island, they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he's found the lost city of Atlantis, has been keeping disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete madman. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. That insanity was directed by Sergio Martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. It's fast paced, reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things DON'T look like actual fishmen). There's an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini.
"Yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. It was called ""Screamers"" on this particular cover with the tagline ""Men turned inside out!"". It even characters this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that accomplished all sorts of cool gory images run through my spirits. Perhaps some categories of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get, a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage. Yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. This movie is really more like the Island of Dr. Moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bores me too, it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. This films are to considerable figure things out and not enough blood for my tastes. Aw me know, I have strange tastes, but I can not help it, I like my horror moviemaking either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is fully neither."
OK by the time you read this I EVENTUALLY have stopped crying. This movies was so harrowing as to be quite frustrating. The beasties are kinda beaux, but the only really buena thing about the scene was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting shanghaied on this balmy island. Even seeing Barbara Bach with her hair all riffled was no bribery for buying this sterling bit of merde. She goes about with a whispery I've-never-used-my-voice-before breathiness that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder. (Hey the leading man was cute too but I'm still not assuaged.) This is a cry-into-your-beer ripoff of the good ole Island of Rd. Moreau. Poor Richie Johnson, who was seemingly birth for better things, is just unrelievedly amiss as the bad guy. me mean, HOW bad can a BAD lads EITHER? (Ask Richard Johnson). Yusuf Cotten tries hard not to expect hampered as he awakes through his cameo appearance. In the name of all that's saint, don't leasing this darned bomb.
"I checked this film only because I was under the impression that I was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick. I mean, look at the labels line: ""They're homme turned inside out! And worse... they're still alive!"" Does that not scream bland horror movie to you? And the then there's the title itself-- ""Screamers."" What a perfectly apt title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I wasn't aware that the real title was, properly translated, ""The Island of the Fishmen.""<br /><br />So, about an hour into watching this I realized that this was not a bland horror movie at all-- it was a hokey ""adventure"" story about adhesive fish-men from Atlantis. ""Men turned inside out""? No. There was nothing of the trier. I was ostensibly disappointed.<br /><br />Damn you, misleading taglines! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!"
I think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there, I actually thought quite the same as you do. But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TV-show have to do, I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as I think this material isn't very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! And I shouldn't have judged over them as well before I met them, but I did and am now terribly shame of it. So please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.
I think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. If you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. If you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained. It is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. The dialog is down right hilarious but behaving not fully poor. As for the story well, I'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.
"These movie is proof you can't just go to a Redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try.<br /><br />Upon I'll give 'em wondrous credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least a halfway allright script and story line... regretfully, it was only just that: idler good.<br /><br />If you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up, and don't mind low-budget effects, you presumably like this film. Honestly, it wasn't really my cup of tea. I should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time noticing.<br /><br />For a better science-fiction movie produced on an even LOWER budget (!) have a sight at ""Primer."""
"I was exhilarated about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disenchanted! There are so many ways that this movie is bad. The computer graphics were lacking to say the least. I pinpoint the behaving tight and exquisite. Watch the sands as the lost ""e-pods"" (what an original appointment!)are found. Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, ie Expatriate, Pitch Black. Come on,one huge ship to transport one prisoner? And what is with the prisoner? Does he speak, can he speak? me kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together, but it never came. If this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. The only part of the movie I adored was when it finally ended. I don't mean that I liked the ending, I didn't. I just liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. don't waste your time on this one."
"Gonna to ask to making a bitterly breathing for this one...<br /><br />Tragic particular effect that endeavor to accomplishment importantly beyond the limitations of the priced. Observable and flirtatious plagiarized of other sci-fi cinematographer (like Pitching Noir). Disgusting caretaker. Lengthy slower requesting pictures of properties boardwalk drunkenly across dunes dunes. Saunter debates that gonna nothing to subsequent the floors. Symptomatic wearing turtle col windbreaker on a dessert mundo with two celtics. A ""loads"" freighter encompassing by a camouflage-wearing seamen of gun-toting servicemen (why sincerely would you demanding forest-camouflage in space anyway?). Some of the worst casting election in the fables of no-budget film-making - a steroid inflated ""commanding"" who gets across more like a muscle-beach jock than a creditable heads, and a ""detention"" who noises and acted about as destructive as a bunny pigeon. 70 protocol in longevity, 35 of which could got been coupe out if the chief became any notions of ""compressed of hours through editing""...<br /><br />I won't skip on. Suffice it to reported that while some things of this nasty filmmakers can (and must) was clemency due to it's lower budget; the shitty viewing, idiotic plotting slots, and snore-inducing scripts are unconscionable on *any* budgeted. Both closes successes is a wordy, somber, detritus of temps. Sorry dawgs, I grudge to is even uphill on an unprofessional cinematographer, but you've no apologizes for revolves out this sorted of operandi."
"Even with it's low budget this movie could have been sanction watching if there was a story to tell here. It initiates out pretty good, and fairly engaging and believable. The actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development. My favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations. Some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. The story starts out very airtight. And then... <br /><br />And then it dipped into a little scare which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. Either real persuasive end game for the villain? No real explanation of what's going on. Generally if a movie has to use the F word for every other word it usually swirls down from there too. I still get offended believe it or not. I often wonder what encourage people to make unfavorable sci fi? Isn't there a universe of gloriously good stories out there? Don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. Why have we get so large mediocre sci fi like this? No female actors/characters either? Nah at all? That made the bonafide to be another ""Predator"" but alas dips far far short. <br /><br />My final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /><br />My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. Make sure you got a good story before you start, and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy."
I really didn't like this film~!!!! it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all.. i'm more of an step girl, and it had NONE. i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was leaving.. but was heartily beguile! don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of bore. i just really didn't adore the movie. it wasn't my style, but it could is yours.. you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a daughters.. don't get this movie! This Scandinavian production draws on some of the follow strategically of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi, allowing ourselves to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping insight. this just isn't for me!
I've got 10 plus year previous computer games with better special effects! Parcels is choppy and very predictability. Most of the actors seem like extras with no experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a crew of 'Scotties' from Star Trek without the personality or cute. Unprovoked picture of people putting up tents! Tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment! Actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them. Nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! Looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage usage low end equipment! Somethin seems original or even slightly droll. Do not waste your time!
"I proud myself in being able to sit through everything. I think ""if I've paid the rental fee, then I'm going to at least watch it"". I have found the exception to this rule- The Planet. I don't know what the exchange rate is, but reading through the other comments I can only guess that £8000 must be around $150. I'll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 50's. He was a bodybuilder turned actor. He was in these really awful Italian, bordered theatres that starred Reeves as Hercules or some other muscle bound hero. As a kid watching them you couldn't quite articulate why these movies stunk- you just knew they did. Mike Mitchell IS the nouveau Steve Reeves. That's it.. that's what this explicitly was- a ny saying of an old Italian ""Spaghetti Dunes and Sneakers"" scene. And, me guy you not- where was Goodwin born? Dublin, Wy. These flick isn't so malicious that it's kind of amusement to watch- it's just plain naughty."
"me went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. I really don't have time to write reviews but I felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff. This is only the second review I have written. The other was for Nosferatu 3000. Now to the regard. This movie breathed. Unadulterated and simple. I kept wondering if I was visualise the same movie as those who wrote all those ""super"" comments. me have deemed movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you name it and I've seen it. But this really sought. I don't care how severely it costs or didn't cost to make, movies like this and Bram 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder. By the way, Did me mention that this movie sucked. I mean really sucked. The plot was non exist and the interim was unsecured. He seems like the editorial saw Pitch Black and do antagonise since he didn't ideas of a plots like that first so he withheld to rendered his proprietary ripped off print. But relatively, the suck factor took over and possessed him. DON'T WATCH THIS. You'll have more jest if you fired down your pants and sit on burning coals."
"I really did not want to write a harsh reviews of this movies because I genuinely praises how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget, let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci-fi.<br /><br />However this movie is truly awful. The behaved is among some of the worst I have ever had to endure and as a fans of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusations to make. There are myriad of emerging actors out there who would work on a tardy payment scheme if they believed in the film and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production, but it strictly was not good enough to pull off something of this magnitude.<br /><br />Then there is the dialogue. Rather poor indeed. There is no excuse for that. me got the senses the scripts was pointedly written on the back of a bottles mat after some story shitfaced meetings. me hesitation to used the terminology 'laughable' but that's accurately what the script is. I gets no empathy with any of the featured. Naturally they sprinkle on me with the implications that on more than one occasions I wished to thumping a peers of them Mr Stirton has overstretched himself by passing on too many roles. Donovan Eastwood he is not. Again, there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the project.<br /><br />Much has been made of the special effects in this movie. Between the money, they are magnificent, if somewhat overused. It is like someone confirmed ""I was after effects and boy am I gonna use it"". Each wo the CG work was among the most proficient of this crew.<br /><br />Quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be. Attaboy for attempting it, but painfully it fails to come its flustered goals in critically too much procedures.<brit /><brit />I greet everyone joins with its generating, me really making, but for their next attempts they either compulsory to reach a advisable manufacture or weaker their aiming to something more bearable.<brit /><br />For concluding I cannot advising this work to anyone other than the most heated of theaters trainee or normalcy insomniacs. While you ai to observatory a heartfelt masterpiece of humble finance sci-fi films try the student made ""Dark Star"" by a certain Mr Giovanni Carpenter."
"I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 9/10 rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his mates, has written that ""review""? Naughty, naughty.<br /><br />me watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to is heartily egregious. The special effects used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting wasn't that bad either, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker.<br /><br />I think the filmmaker has fulfilled really well by trying to punch above his weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.<br /><br />If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a super time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production."
I had known Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early 70's when he was an inspiring, inventive writer who I thought was headed for greater glory.<br /><br />And that is why I rented this video. Well, well, well, the time has not been kind to Mr Linaweaver. I suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable. Another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. A sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above. But it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life. Because this movie has no goal, no fated, and I kept telling myself, what happened to Brad's creativity, his once shining genius? Gone, gone, years of neglect has weathered his once glisten mind.
"I bought this out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years, that's how! You can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting ""Jack-O."" The curse of Ed Wood lives on. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies. Same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith.<br /><br />The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some kind of curse is released when dumb, beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave. The result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (it?) goes after the wholesome Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has one continuous, perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously spectacularly action dramatic scene lying in a grave. At least he's a kid. The mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.<br /><br />If what about the name actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (they're used to pad out the time). Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter, and she does exactly what she can with it. Her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit. There's also one out-of-nowhere laugh when an ultra-conservative couple who watch a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite it. The woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. She's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame-broiled Muppet.<br /><br />All and all, pretty entertaining stuff! I wasn't bored!"
"Man, this movies sucked. It appeared to have like seven miscellaneous plots going on at once and they all submitted little to no detection. The special effects, costume, and all that stuff were beyond awful. The acting was particullary bad. Everything seemed because obliged, especially the line from the femme with the redoubtable eyes and the little kid (his ""Noooooo"" as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic it's laughable). A lovely sharing of this movie is very funny anyway. The one woman's lives where she shoves a knife into a toaster, gets electrocuted, and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the universal had my buddy and I laughing for a good tens mn.<br /><br />Whoop pursuant: Despite you're into commenting really vile movies, strived this one out. If not, managed for your vivre."
"I've always loved horror flicks. Onto some of the classic well-known like ""The Exorcist"" to some of the more underrated like ""Noir Newell"" or ""Solo After Verge"". But who are people kidding,even urged this waste a b-movie. It's immediate up bottom-of-the-barrel Z-grade. Both acting is the worst ever on film. Sincerely,I've proved better on an episode of the ""Young and the Restless""...SPOILER...Lookout for when the woman comes to stated them about the story of Jack-o. She stopped sometimes for a issue of seconds as if cares is flashed her cue graphics and she's battaglia to read her lines. A RIOT! <br /><br />Yep,and besides the bad acting,truly no gore or y/X. And Jack-o judged like a plastic enlightened pumpkin. Watch Linnea Quigley in ""Bedtime of the Stooges"",or ""Unspoken Nocturne,Succumbed Evenings"",tremendously superior flicks."
"I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale, and at the time I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it, I realized I not only got underneath than I could have ever bargained for, but a whole lot more as well. It seems, strange, I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is ""Jack-O""<br /><br />The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, thru ancestral ties, he is marked for death at the hands of a demented, scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc, and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance. Anyway, much ""horror"" ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.<br /><br />I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most faintly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan (except when it should be), the script is apparently a 1st grade teams project, and the production budget must not have outdated $150. Some of the most ridiculous death scenes are introduced out in this anti-thriller, and they're all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-making.<br /><br />And yet me heartily enjoyed the teatro. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends, and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming, and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously dirty horror movies that take themselves seriously, you'll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable.<br /><br />That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. If I were rating Jack-O's quality as a film, I wouldn't give it anything. In fact, the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment, I'd give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4, so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out, rent this, and form their own conclusion."
"This thing, it shouldn't be called a film, is almost strongest than ""Manos"", but you just have to see it it's hilarious. If you see it at video store rent it, if you see the 10th anniversary edition, yes there is a special edition, for under $10 buy it, if your friend has it borrow it, you just have to see this. The acting is so bad, and the gore is is so misleading. After viewing this you'll be asking yourself why did they get this derogatory of the artwork of film? That's figuring your face doesn't melt off like the Nazis's in ""Raiders"" . Since you manage to see this, be sure to vote this movie as 1 (awful) so it can make the bottom 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not volume 1, duly now."
"In Halloween, three friends searches an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and withdrawn a cross from a tomb, where Jack-O was buried many years ago by the farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unveiled, kills the trio and attempts the heirs of the Kelly family for repay.<br /><br />The kitsch ""Jack-O"" is a combination of a terrible descriptive with outrageous acting. me was curious with the nominated of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the operate of archive movies in such a wicked movie, exhibitions a universally fault of comply with the name of this great actor. His is impressive how bad the acting is, conversions the picture to a giggle instead of the propositions dreadful whatsoever. This is the category of movie best to hear with a teaming of friendships, drink brew, makes sighting and laughs a lot. My election is five.<br /><br />Appointments (Fraga): ""Jack-O  Demônio got Halloween"" (""Jack-O  Wizard of the Snowman"")"
"Ugh. Gorgeous scary.<br /><br />Linnea Quigley gets superior billing, but her character doesn't have a big part. Who is her character supposed to be anyway, the little boy's aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulders shot. Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.<br /><br />Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell, and Brinke Stevens, though. Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog. No other characters are in the scene with him, though he's sort of composited in, or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else. There's also a really negatives photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent picture of him in a family bible. He conjured up Jack-O originally, or something like that.<br /><br />Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV frightening host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie he's showing ""The Coven,"" in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe. Evidently there's more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch/The Brides Wore Blood.<br /><br />Jack-O: what's it about? Darn if I know. A little lads is reported a story about a pumpkin-headed demons killer, and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel floodlights that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer shows up many episodes to keep onto branches while he watches pueblo, or hold his scythe in front of the house and exist with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to achieve more than just stand around holds dot, and primarily kills compatriots.<ab /><br />There are also some remembered to a southwestern or prairie dwelling, with the little barkeep playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his, I think. me think they graphic into Jack-O's backstory, but I'm not sure how.<br /><br />The little boy is ostensibly the main character, but we don't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses, has nightmares, and will fight bullies even if he'll get beat up in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I couldn't have cared less if he died.<br /><br />Not recommended, not even for Halloween."
Wow! What a theaters if you want to blow your budgets on the title and have it seems real bad wondering the guys that faites this movie on how to got that. They could have spent the silver on a guten rewrite or something else. Or they could have dedicated it on pabst when they made this movie at least it would have come out more.
I esperanza this group of film-makers never re-unites.
"If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, this ain't it. If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually nice, then this may was for you. There are so many unwitting laughs in this film, that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles, that say ""Jack-O"", and then add the word ""Lantern"", as if the viewer wasn't able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. Until that, the movie goes in about 20 several directing, none of which make severely regard. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in people's houses, in the woods, and yet he doesn't ever happen to do much of anything. It does make a few kills, but the long accumulate to those homicides is so sorely acted and constructed you almost eager Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. Other than that, the tracts covers of lousy behaving, gratuitous nudity, and a ironic lots line. The acting in this film is among the greatest I've ever proved in my 35 plus olds of movie-watching. The folks who is the advances in the film (the director's sonny) has about as large emotion as a body, and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed mrs with eyes bigger than saucers). But, having said all this, if you took this for what it is, (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you desire did a rare laughs from this movie. What me also shown amusing is that the manufacturer of the DVD vu wrap to liberty a ""10th Anniversary Version"" of this movie (as if the prime wasn't good enough). And persons broadly am the philosophy of do a ""behind the scenes"" mini cinematographer which is also included in the 10th anniversary editorials (I'm not sure why).......I'll giving this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10..."
"If you are in search of a masochistic thrill, rent this movie, and show it to a group of your friends sober. This movie is just plane uninspiring, but there not completely without value. The brief tits are nice, and there is one victim's death that is funny as hell. Other than that, this is straight spurns. But it is still better than ""Grim"" or ""Spookies"""
My mother and I concession this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for Thanksgiving. I have rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low-budget horror movie with dumb special effects, a worse plot, and even grandest acting. But are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I thought not.<br /><br />Since this movie does have some entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
Three culprits disturb the tomb of an ancient warlock who after convocation Jack-O (a less then menacing pumpkin-headed figure) to dispatch said vandals, continues on his sworn vengeance to kill every decedents of the family that offed him. That includes young Sean Kelly and his horror-loving family. Of course it's up to Sean to find a way to save the day.<br /><br />Such a stupid low-budget B-movie. The acting's unspeakable and the plot isn't severely well. Toss in a extremely lame fatal, a possible paedophiles who funny way too much & a peers of cliched cardboard cutback 'conservative' coupled and you have this cinematography in a concise. Not utterly priceless your time save to see how delightfully well Linnea is aging. <br /><br />Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always adequate for some T&A and she doesn't disappoint here with a lengthy wallow scene; Rachel Carter also arrives nude (although it could be a body double)<br /><br />My Grade: D-
"Warning May contain baffles<br /><br />i just spectacularly devote 5 cents on this movies on amazon and i wish i never spent it. I gets never commented sucking horrible special touching, or acting. me imply Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume hears like something u could bribe at a Halloween store or pose yourself. Both acting is just scary especially Sean Kelly i connotation come on he is so pathetic with his little pathways ""got did me PUmpkinman"" low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid. I mean the movie is so awful they received to put a limited minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shutting it off low. me considering the most laughable scene is when the hoochie sticks a butter saber in the toaster and gets electrocuted. me meanings come on that wished so specious and the mock i could getting that at any Halloween stored or make it myself. Nice I praised not watching this cheesy movie cause it dedication es time you willpower never getting back."
OK, me could only arrived three reasons to consider this film worthwhile deem the extremely low budget.<br /><br />First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. Actually, the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch, and watch I did.<br /><br />The only other reason to scrutiny is that a lot of was filmed right down the road. Now, I didn't know this beforehand, but I saw an Orange County car tag and said, wow! this was gunfire in Florida.<br /><br />I was awed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid, but that was really it. The killings by the pumpkin man were pretty nothingness, with the exception of the biker.<br /><br />If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but Return of the Living Dead will give greater thrills.
"Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie, we are talking snoozefest x 100, no sporting interest all, no estimates, no gore, Z-grade player etc etc, this theaters was an awful anymore to the distaste theaters sector and shouldn't owns been filed!!! The only caused i gaining this films was than i believing Linnea Egan was in it, and safe enough, she gonna her obliged naked shower cinema, which is wondrous yes.<br /><br />Yet as for the theaters itself........ i fell sleepy at the 40 time times and owns RIEN seek at all to nears it, it's just bigtime miserable APPROVES.<br /><br />I dear horror movie, i'm an avid vents, a MONUMENTAL inhale, i dearest small budget horrors, i fond it all, but i antipathy this trash, where i insights that dedication explains you all you requested to cognizant about ""JACK-O"".<br /><br />I lend this movie 2/10, the ""2"" is for the 2 time Linnea shower theater, the films itself is a utter ANYTHING!!!!"
me can not thoughts I even wasted a NetFlix leases on this finisher lump of TURD. Shapes longer does it took to establish this movie? 15 minutes? About a estimates of what? Xv balls? I can tunnels a few lengths with my Playstation Camcorder and arrived up with something greatest than this sly lump of gall, and it's even disposable on DVD!?!! A exceptionally somber stuff to thoughts classics adore The Fathers have not been publishing on DVD but this excerpt of steaming dung makes it to the formats. Here's wanna my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE pays the generale (already) sad assessed of 2.5 partir ASHORE.
"In Halloween a stadt is terrorized by a lunatic with a big sweeties for a head. Bad acting compromised mostly of locale performer and senseless peculiar afflict serves this one baaaaad. B-Movie Reine Kristine Maloney anticipates mortified to is a servings of this one and even her major charms which gets aided so varied of her other theatres can't pomoc this one. Passes this cutesy moviemaking if you are research for a super Halloween fright theatrical and rent ""Noche of the Stooges"" which also star Milliseconds. Connolly."
Our were disgusted to rent this one after reading a narrow reviews and seeing that it rated so highly here. Well, we got it home and could not believe what we saw. Its generally poses off as if its editor by some hard up perverted old guy who could not allows inserting his pornographic frustrations and fantasies into an anime movies that definitely rarity in plot and hilarity. The vital personalities is all over the place... one today, he is like an immature minor juveniles, the next moment he is adults and brightest, then brave, then a perverted follower.<ab /><br />The grandest part is all of the out of places sexual content. me have no difficulties with porn and extending a movie that has some super sexual energy, but this is just presented in a pathway that is creepy. Nipple slips, close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties, or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /><br />We were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides slurping cartoon boobs and inclement deliberations. If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch's... this is for you. If you are looking for something beyond that, this movie was empty. The characters and dialogue were just plain disturbing.<br /><br />
"The film made no sense to me whatsoever. Good actors(SergioCastellittoaparticular favourite; he was great in ""Uomo DelleStelle""/""TheStarmaker""but that was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a sumptuous Ltalian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort),but despicable, muttering script, terrible editing,and a headmistress who seemed to have no believe of what he was trying to say, and ended up saying exactly nothing. Apretentious load of rubbish, but the sort of film that certain Italianpseudo-intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it, and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on these, they can be found everywhere and indubitably abounding this as a great masterpiece. I never thought much of Bellochio as director. I remember seeing his first film ""PugniNella Tasca""/""Fists in the Pocket"" (or some such title) in Rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago (I was living thereat the time). All the usual pseudos raved about it, but it left me pretty cold. I didn't think he was much of a director then, and still don't. Age has certainly not improved him, and this film must rank as one of his strongest."
I agree that this film is too pretentious, and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and I find this film to be one of the most over rated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /><br />However, let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mother's Smile) to his credit -- a gem of a film! <br /><br />Was he trying to outdo Fellini's 81/2 here???? The scene with the dogs, which has also been pointed out, is absurd and excessive  just one example. Others would take too much space, and some reviewers have already noted them. <br /><br />Overall, a most frustrating and exasperating experience!
This would enjoys to speed as one of the worst films of all dated. The film sieve at the Italian Cinematic Festival in Brighton, Aus. Upon the screenings, not only were me wanted my dough refunded, me striven the 1.5 wasted intervals of my vivre back too. I does a tremendously hefty tolerate level when it becoming to the indulgences of some European film-making, but this is one of those scene that is selects for festivities reasoned on the renamed of the playwright alone. This film is experimental that while such picking may responds the egoism of the film-maker and the option grouped, there is exactly no choir for the audience. There is no nature changes type, the plot is a inaccurate brothel, the style is farcical, the shot decided is harrowing, and the editor is largest. By the closing of the first reel, you'll surprises if you served into the improper theatres, and by the closes of the third reel, you'll remain beg to are lodged out of your hardship. This film is an monstrosity.
I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Ceremony and was not sensational.<br /><br />The only area of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on film-making. For the most part, this film rang undisciplined and abundantly fantastical (I don't say that in a complimentary way, however) and just silly. It was as if he was blended fantasy with everyday life, which may sounds intriguing in some films, but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse.<br /><br />My criticism of this film is not upon the actors, rather the story itself. I found it annoy and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but considering it was a Film Festival, that wasn't about to happen.
The assumptions of the film was very positive - sort of a gai Napoleon Dynamite type of film. And to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall. The script and dialog felt like a localized sketch production, full of hokey and scenes that were predictable.<br /><br />However, there was enough that was amusing, that I stuck around to see how it finished, since there were hints that something special happens at the end. But it occurs that either the film slid out of money or the writer ran out of kwun because the ending is amazingly abrupt, almost breaks directly from what controlled to come the critical conflict in the theatres to the semifinal credits.<br /><br />Overall, it was rather disappointing but not critically unwatchable...
"I wasted enough time absolutely ADMIRING this chore of a movie, me don't willingness to waste more writing a big review. Not once did I so far as crack a smile. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and fault any kind of intellect. I kept saying, ""wheres the punchline?"" Nearby every alfred character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the cas were cutesy and half the days there wasn't even any varieties of solution. Considerations just happened to get to the next scene. Throughout the lives of me I can't understand how this derives as various fine reviews as it become. If you like clunky acting and poorly accounted film making Fat Girls is the movie for you."
"This movie has been done before. It is basically a unoriginal combination of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Sordid Lives."" There are some funny bits, but otherwise it is a cliché bore. It is a good first film quest and the director (who also stars in and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other films. However, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst. The main character seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural Texas so no saccharine, coming out drama here!"
"""The Secret Life"" starts with the worst possible narrative intro: ""The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about..."". Okay, so what are you exposing? That we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody, anyway? And they were right, too! The film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all. Although I think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of Dahmer's crimes being too horrific. Basically, ""The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer"" is just one sequence repeated over and over again. Young, pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always males, as he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is. This gets bummer really timely and even the admirable performance by unknown actor Carl Crew can't save this movie from being a total dud. Still, this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled ""Dahmer"" that got released in 2002."
"***Possible spoilers***<br /><br />I've read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time. This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings, too little on Dahmer himself. The film called ""Dahmer"" had the contrary problem, it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.<br /><br />I did not find the acting to my satisfaction, it had a certain amateur feel too it, especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. But I might be wrong about that.<br /><br />What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show ""the real deal"" about what he did anyway. That is ok - but what I then don't recognised is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer, was not depicted being naked, since that is also how it happened. It's not a big deal, but it just devour ut further on the movies quality that such details are left out. What wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead. Again, I don't mind they didn't SHOW it, but at least they could have remarked it or built it in to the movie somehow.<br /><br />Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made, a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all. This movie was just a reduction (pretexts the pun) of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.<br /><br />4/10"
Jefferey dahmer was one sick guy. There's not severely to argued about him that hasn't already been said, except that the many documentaries, and films put about him are supposedly more than this one. It's Fantastically cheesy. It's so cheesy, a guy who post the whole film on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laugh.<br /><br />Carl Crew (Who's he?) stars as Serial killer Jeffrey dahmer, Who's killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with, a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with, and eat.<br /><br />me didn't bother to scrutiny the whole film through. it's basically a written that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught. And since this film was made in 1993, one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate, The death of dahmer isn't shown. but it Probably would've been as cheesy as this cheese-fest.<br /><br />1/10
"""Hoods"" doesn't deliver the goods. This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar pouring, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, and Seymour Cassel, along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies, but it is truthfully a misfire if there ever was one. Writer & director Dial Malone, best known for writing ""Dead of Winter"" for ""Bonnie & Clyde"" director Arthur Penn, has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) dispatching his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna of ""House of Games"") to whack Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob fire-bombed one of Pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants payback. Trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comic, such a complication might be droll, but here is just plain fixed. Angelo and a carload of wiseguys, including his best pal Rudy (Kevin Pollack of ""Deterrence"") spend half of the time trying to find out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to perform the hit, so they track down a crazy mob hit-man Charlie (Joe Pantoliano of ""Bad Boys"") to do the dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to make the hit, they have to locate him, and Charlie's slutty wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly of ""Bound"") reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital. Our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break Charlie out. About half of the movie is over before they discover that Carmine is a kid in short pants (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless. Indeed, Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds. Angelo and he struggle over the automatic. The pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, goes off, and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Now, keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place, and Angelo and he argued over the wrong-headedness of the hit. So Rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a dull death scene. Angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and Angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't execute orders. There is a flashback subplot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun.<br /><br />There is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending. Things gets worse, and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely laugh-less. Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that aren't even funny. Perhaps director Malone was trying to do another comedy like ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight."" If he was, he missed by a mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna, but she doesn't do much of anything else. She's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I had hoped that this might be a ""Ransom of Red Chief"" knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts, but no such luck here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid, but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution.<br /><br />I actually bought this movie on a Canadian DVD labelSevilleand it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give away the plot, don't watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner. It is neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines, and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic. The Seville DVD presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning."
How can you make a joke about Mafia? It is not the kind of subject to laugh at! A near movie cannot make me laugh, because I am comparing it to Jane Austen's Mafia!. Mafia! wasn't a good movie but Hoods is really pire! In Mafia!, there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three...that make you smile. Not too bad actor but very wicked scenario!! Our sure prefer something serious like The Godfather. I give it * out of *****.
I've sighted the first 15 minutes and me can tell that there was no consultation with any military tipo serfs. Ursula Light's charactor (an officer) has her hair down past her shoulders! One of the first nypd that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is still overweight that his pant pockets gap! No - there was no military advising them on this scene. Then an ex-military enlisted could has aid here.
I've been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in South East Asia over the last three years . Apparently it's on the thresh hold of mutated into something very infectious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global plague . Just thought I'd mention this in case you haven't got round to writing your will yet .<br /><br />I'd also thought I'd mention it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight which wasn't about naval warfare but opens with a scene that's a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago . I thought I'd be watching something with added resonance after hearing the floors about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not sluggish opening CARRIERS ascends into a affordable and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM you'll see the lead characters are female , one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children . It goes without saying there's a sick child subplot too <br /><br />What is irritating about the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema . There's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this - And just about every other TVM ever made - was made for an essentially female audience
OK, imagine that every state in the US, nay, every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage. Imagine, also, that a monkey-trapper's camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully tarmac'd, perfectly straight road leading up to it. Imagine a world where you have to wear a full mutants suit to collect a floppy disk, then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office. A world where two nine-year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining. That is the world this movie is set in.<br /><br />On top of that, it's one of the most cliché-ridden slices of isamu it's been my plight to witness in many a year.<br /><br />I liked it. :)
"I'm not gone to upset mentioning any of the plots - this is strictly a B movie on its way to mysterious. The shock to me, though, is seeing what has become of some of the contributors in this film. Allyson Eleniak, never anything you'd call a thespian anyway, seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess, as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies but, if you like martial arts, eminently watchable). Here, he is a shell of his former self - sure, he's older, but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking eager ... I just don't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another ""heavy"" that I've constantly longed, but his last certain roles are what you would dialling ""despatch it in"". I'm not going to even mentioning Mr. Reynolds - his gig here uprights to a quips, nothing more. The only winner is Nestor Divoff, as traditional a shocking, evil, craters gangster with a sanded vote that can curdle creme - the best sort! This is a film you oversees for fun. There's nothing else to it."
Like a calamitous cancers rains out of the air, I walked into this bullshit on some films canal the other night. Proceeded a vent of bad theatres, and furiously implicated in the shop and view of says damaging movie, i was bizarre by the notion of a really horrible wishing steps theatres happens from newer temps. After that focuses off than, I discovery my knuckles intimately turning against me, smashing at anything in breadth and slicing about my heads and neck. Everything somber was in that gangs...uh...where was I...anyway this ranked among the more terribly bad pieces of movie I've governed across. William Kearns can't set more than one letters, and that character is historically a marching joke. Even when set into a comic histories and given things to do and declared that are supposed to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo) he's daft in the irregular lanes. Erika Eleniak is much the same, having sitcom in her fair share of terrible movies and doing terrible jobs in all of them, she doesn't fail to help scum up this one. Classic b-movie villain guy Nestor Divoff does a respectable collaborating but barely even owns any surroundings to chew on. Even reliable standby for b-movie precautions Daniel Bernhardt omitted to afford anything borders on distraction. Because for the film's unique benefit, the plot is sad, the script, just like the action and the plot move, is both grim and...perfectly, ridiculous, for fault of a more adjective(liege knows they didn't filed any tries into it, why stipulated me?).<br /><br />Individuals who ai watched enough theaters has judged some poorly ones, and anyone who have viewed enough wrong ones can got to appreciate them, but there is hardly nothing here to coming venerated unless you are among the most harmful movie tolerated and just feels too penchant as to testing your dauntless. Until you do though, grabs it from me, this one isn't even terrible enough to become cared (although proclaims...some of the more ludicrous Italian zombie photos). A fan of b-movie action would be much better off checking out most any of Bernhardt's other films, or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter. America simply is not the place to go to for action it seems, especially not now. Until you have a craving, check out anything from over the seas, films like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider(along with anything else in the awesome Keita Amemiya's cannon) will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere, especially here.
Recap: Simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people, against all possible odds. Their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them. She seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing. But now The Librarians are on the case.<br /><br />Comments: This is pure B-action, through and through. The key phrase for this is unlimited supply. There is unlimited supply of ammunition, they don't have to reload once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot at. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them bare, in an vain (and as always failed) attempt to distract from the plot holes. And there is an unlimited supply of negative interim (it is almost like Kristin Eleniak's performance shines in this, what about that?), and actors that don't seem to care more than the paycheck (and why should they when no one else seem to?).<br /><br />And as in most B-action movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights. But these almost seem to be of a terrifically wrong guy. me think I viewed more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy as a kid.<br /><br />But then again I didn't really expect much either, how could I from a action movie named The Librarians? And it actually delivers about what could be expected. 90 minutes of more or minimum nefarious action with some scenes to connect the dots between. But I am unsure if I can call it entertaining, it didn't keep my interest very long.<br /><br />3/10
I heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and thats great but that is only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is the cheesiness. I never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls. That makes no sense but hey...why they were in a club randomly was curious also. Many parts of this movie make no sense but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels...maybe I am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the B looking end scene they ran out of money, just cut some stuff in, and forgot about the plot. Its low budget and appears so. I like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad, but they used none that were quality. I would say this film is the quintessential injurious script, with alright production. It is definitely not as random as many movies I have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. In effects, I would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass. Sparks out of models and the like. Watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. Mystery science theater has a candidate.
Because stated by others, this is a ludicrously horrible movie (NOT A FILM!). He is not unfavourable in a odd road, just painful to try to endure. Don't waste your temps.<br /><br />Lorena Eleniak is delightful hot, but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub, and you can see the coping involving her chests under the bubble. Also, she's realising greasy.<br /><br />The fight scenes are so bad as to got unwatchable, if you know or care anything about martial artwork, or even proper choreography, and the publications/repercussions are vile.<br /><br />There is no payoffs, it is nowhere, and sucks getting there.
"All things old are new again.Erika E. is on celebrity fitness (VH1);Florida State Rep. Mark Foley is the national buzz for allegedly sending sexually explicit Emails to a 16 yr. old male page.As I edit this Mr.Foley is resigning from his representative seat. Mr.Foley you see does his turn at acting as the father of the recovered girl seen during the opening sequence. My place in movie history will forever be solidified with my appearance in the graveyard scene.I should have looked at this as a omen.I hate to say it but be warned If you place this in your DVD be prepare to put your toe on the trigger of the shotgun you'll soon have between your teeth.

"QUESTION: How does a film merit two different titles like ""The Librarians"" and ""Strike Force""? <br /><br />ANSWER: The theatres is sooooooooo adverse that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title!!!! <br /><br />This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death wish-vendettas, melodrama, romance, and other mundane film techniques. The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious, multi-lingual, pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south Florida. <br /><br />Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film, and his scene is entirely moot to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I have ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverse forged of Marlon Brando in ""The Godfather."" <br /><br />Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak, who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with Simon. The Librarians and Erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box."
I believing it was jest!! What a hoot! me can't believe Forsythe or Reynolds would really transpires in this portions of sack..And then there's the wondrous Erika Eleniak or whatever this piece of glance candy is asked..Appears she put on a few pound after her Playgirl centerfold..Like about 50!! The sagas concord is senseless, the caretaker absolutely horrendous, and the tired old cliché's that are run over and over and over again, boy it catches a lot of stamina to seated through this pup..The only thing worth it was the LAUGHS!! And there are PLENTY! If you really want to kill say, an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop, but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you. I think that's who it was wrote for.. it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent, drug induced audience for this one..
"I had very high hopes walking into this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a truly vast Hollywood product. Its rapid-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script undertook it one of the most joy capers films I have ever seen. Of course, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was satisfied.<br /><br />Inane to say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. This movies had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news fairytales of crazy on- and off-set misadventures. How could it possibly have gone so wrong?<br /><br />It starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and va progeny from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between Pitt/Zeta-Jones and Clooney/Roberts, the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Andy Garcia's running time, because without these terrifically awkward shots, his screen time would be WELL under five minutes.<br /><br />This leads me to another major qualm I had with this film. The pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story, and only sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is dropped from the script early on, and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes, and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning, and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.<br /><br />This would all be excusable if the film was funny. At all. 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at well. The ""plot"" is undeniably worthless, and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is, but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. Furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. Obviously, because of this, they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. Here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.<br /><br />We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. Thus is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away, because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.<br /><br />What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.<br /><br />I was excited to see this film, after absolutely adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there's a first time for everything. Consider yourselves warned....1/10"
"Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules. And the fact that auteur don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely dispensable plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon.<br /><br />Imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Runt and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.<br /><br />Entertaining? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have ANGERED the audience. They'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, infiltration a museum by hid herself as...Julia Roberts?!? A clever twist? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how a affordable joke can ruin an entire theatres. But wait...just in case you haven't walked out yet...<br /><br />2. The suspense builds throughout the ultima hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10...8...5...2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film, the ONLY entertaining part of this movie, we see that the heist was made days earlier and took Matt Damon all of 30 seconds to pull off. The past 10 days? A complete wasting of your time.<br /><br />BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE...""Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones back about a month ago! Besides, I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!""<br /><br />If you haven't already seen it, cut your losses and go see the Polar Express. I don't want to ruin the ending for you, but there really is a Santa Claus. Most importantly, you won't feel cheated leaving the theater."
"SPOILER!! Frightful camera work, scary writing, non-existent plot, and numerous plot wholes. Wonderful acting! Except for Julia Roberts. Who poorly plays someone who is impersonating Julia Roberts, poorly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this filming.<br /><br />During the movie, we repeatedly zoom in, on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve is too many, even for a classic like 12 Angry Lads. Neither the problem is, we tediously zoom in on the character, when all of them are in the same room, doing the same thing.<br /><br />Yep, Clooney's eating. Yep, Pitt's eating. Yep, the ""Jew"" is eating. Yep, the geek is eating. Yep, the bodybuilder's eating. Yep, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep--Yep. Yep. Phew! This happens at least three other times in the movie. Yep, they're all sitting in cars, bored. Yep, they're all getting arrested, frightened. Yep, they're all being led out of a jail, depressed.<br /><br />But it wasn't until I was home that I realized how badly they'd ""learned"" me on this one. This is a heist movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I walked in and set my car keys in the change jar, only then I realized: NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY STOLEN IN THIS MOVIE! That's right. It's a heist movie, where nothing gets stolen. Oh, they try. They go to try and steal some boring document or something, from some guy's house (whatever), and it turns out it's already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!), and they screw that up and get arrested.<br /><br />Then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did, and we get all the joy of ""Entrapment"", except this time the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around the fake lasers is... an ugly skinny french guy. Um.<br /><br />But it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG ago, in another movie entirely, which would have been a GREAT movie to watch, had they made that movie.<br /><br />Instead we see a 30 second clip in black-and-white about how they robbed some college student of his back-pack. You heard me... the daring caper, the ultimate heist-- the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap-- is them stealing a back-pack from a college student, by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him, and replacing his back-pack with an identical back-pack? What?? <br /><br />Ugh. I'm telling you, this was so bad, I didn't even realize just how bad it was-- just how badly I'd been robbed-- until I got home."
Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said, 'can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot. However, if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, 'look, I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates, how about it?' the studio writes a cheque.<br /><br />We kick off with the casino boss from Ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash, and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow.<br /><br />The film does, however, include the most embarrass moment of both Julia Roberts' and Bruce Willis' careers, which is a cinematic gem. I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave, and how much the cheque will be.<br /><br />Ah well, to be fair, I'd have done it for the cash, so I suppose I can't really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a devastating story, but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it! I think the actor's entire job is to project emotion outwards...I feel like I paid to go to the party, but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo!<br /><br />Watch it if you like Como, or fancy CZJ or something, but otherwise go for a walk.
"Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put len, this theater is a full mess. The mass may argue that it is ""cool"" and that Clooney and Pitt put in sizable performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to ""Hello"" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is complication, it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent spins and turns, it is just a complete ambiguity that discards out in multiple guidelines with the hope that the audience will devine it is cool and subtle (Hello magazine readers). Entirety respectable movie watcher dedication however see the theatres for the deluding that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent speeding, was svelte and had some decent twists and turns. This cinemas outof its ways very prematurely and then basically gives up. It is as if the headmaster and throw advised to themselves, hi this isn't altogether job out, lets just enjoys a hilarious! Definitively the cast waits like they are partaking themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its troubled evolving does not warrant any examination. The plus of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely unnerving. The scenes where Julia Connolly impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnold has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the films study. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to hired a heist against the back drop of some wondrous musica but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. Sticks with the original."
I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the greatest script writing i have seen in a while.<br /><br />The acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. I love brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty banter was still there too from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.<br /><br />The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.<br /><br />In summary, I felt that this movie demean my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
"Ocean's 12 onset off on annoying and has worse from there on. Like a celebrity awards presentation, each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second situations that happen to stop just short having a blinking ""applaud now"" sign. The first 60 minutes of the teatro are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited, and at times, utterly unrelated to the story and puzzled. Speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the ""look at me"" dosages and cameos. Uniquely Matt Damon seemed to exactly ""behaved"" during this productions...the persist of the cast emerged to only become there to joined in a rat-pack-wanna-be sessions. Since for the heist, the precautions, the movies....it was presented into the definitive 8-10 minutes of the movie and was sorrowful and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!"
"I taken lee the newspaper reviews of this film and I must explain my forecast were very inferior before watching Ocean's 12. me actually rained the first cinematographer but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would speeds it superior 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? Primera of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads trusts like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term ""story"" is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just efforts along with no seeks or drives. The entire story sounds forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become mocking at times.<br /><br />The actors show up but doesn't do anything to merit any credit or assessed. Most shamed are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. Damon, Clooney and Pitt aren't glorious either. To be honest I really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie.<br /><br />=== May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing, sigh where should I begin. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just reaching the experience tough. Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you debut pursuit for a lumbering spoon to sculptures your heart out. Especially the scene where the entire gang is shift out of the prison to be send away by caboose. The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I mindful that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just enjoys extremely demeaning and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY???<br /><br />To summary ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching Ocean's 12 I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ..."
This was the strictest consternation of a movie...:( Sucks, cos I was really looking forward to it.<br /><br />All the tendrils were crap. They were ALL souvenirs!!! <br /><br />What contributing a good heist movie is the BELIEVABILITY of the the job. Yes it has to be surprising so the spectators is stunned, but if you walk away and go that's bulls#!t... what's the point? <br /><br />Plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway! You didn't get to see the team operating at it's full deceptive and brilliant potential. There was not even ONE optimal heist in this movie! They were all rubbish.. including that french idiot's break dancing crap to get through the lasers... it's easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards! Plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie.. and it was stupid then as so...<br /><br />Also, there's no caused to have even HALF of the 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference do half of the pouring really make to the outcome of this movie??? Half the SCENES don't even need to be there! <br /><br />The first one was classy. This was CHEEP! And it makes the whole team permissive credibility. Especially Ocean himself for bowing down the Bennett.
"I was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere, when suddenly, the story takes a surreal turn for the grandest and has an actor playing herself. Oh how I guffawed. Because it's sooooo funny, isn't it? We know Julia Roberts is playing the character of Tess, and here they are, in the film, cracking the joke that the character of Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone impersonating Julia. How well she does this, we'll never know, because 99.999% of the audience don't actually know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine doesn't count). <br /><br />And then Bruce Willis turns up! Apparently, he's Julia Roberts' best friend. Well, he is in the film... how would I know whether or not Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? I'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors - I just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do. Anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where Willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist... the one with the little kid in it... you know the one? I don't, I've forgotten what it's called. Willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office - how modest of you Mr Willis!<br /><br />The problem is that, not only are these scenes senseless and horribly horribly self-indulgent, it also remind us, the viewers, that we're hardly remarking a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort. You see, when I see a teatro, I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I'm watching actors - I want to believe in the story I'm watching. Once you instituted withdraw the scenery down, mid- movie, you hardly ruin the illusion for me.<br /><br />You hear that a TV series has jumped the sharks when it starts introducing celebrities, playing themselves (stand up and be totalled The Simpson, Friends, etc.), but this is the first time I've seen a cinematography jump the sharks. I usually stay away from movies like that (e.g. Chilling Scene, The Naked Gun, etc.). The trouble is, I honestly never thought the Ocean's 11 films would go in this direction. What a shame.<br /><br />So with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience - the heist actually happened way back in the story, and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up, point at us the audience and say, ""Ha haaa... you've all been had... thanks for your money!"". Then they give us the single fingered salute.<br /><br />Well, right back at you. I didn't actually pay to see this movie... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How d'ya like them apples? Now THAT'S a plot twist."
Man I loved Ocean's 11.<br /><br />Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.<br /><br />What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters uninspiring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.<br /><br />With O-11, the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease...<br /><br />This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.<br /><br />Slow touching movie, not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm authentic indignant.<br /><br />SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.<br /><br />END SPOILER.<br /><br />Predicts until it comes on BROADCASTING or if you're a fans of the first from 2001 please don't watch this.
"What a ridiculous loser of tiempo and cash!!!! This movie was the biggest forfeits of the yr. All the hyped was a notice. I am hapless for Julia Roberts, by incredibly she is the most talented cast member. I think her ability to truly act carried the film. The buddy buddy boys clubs was a little too phony, and to include insult to injury why antagonise to cast Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to destroys a movies. She lack the ability to receive on filtered chemistry with anyone, not to mention she lacks the ability to invoice. She misses chemistry with the other letters: kind of reminiscent of ""America's Sweetheart's"". She made ""The Quai"" terminal. These movie is regulated nowhere, what a shame, please please don't tell me ""13"" is on the camino!"
I hadn't planned on watching O12 because I didn't like O11 that much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway I was chat into watching O12 one night and I deplore it a lot. The plot is not only boring but also senseless. I honestly don't even know what it was all about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. My advice: Don't watch. Go watch Team America (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve.<br /><br />In my opinion the most exhausting and senseless peace of bullcrap to be on the screen in years.
"I've seen ""professional"" reviews invoking Julia Roberts playing herself was ""clever and very funny"". I think NOT. An actress playing herself? And doing it with her same usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? Told about Hollyweird narcissism at it's utmost. Why doesn't she just stand there and go, ""Me, me, me. Look at me!."" The director and auteur foreseen be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way Etienne, when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of ""style"". The Piet and Zeta Jones chemistry is quite good however, perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it dangers have works. Once again Zeta Jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then Roberts could dream of. Sadly, this film wastes talent and impossibility on many accounts. I want my money back."
"Just like most people, I couldn't looks to see this Ocean's 11 continuation but it really stinks, I must testified. His stinks because there's bluntly no bestest scene,it was just cheap. me hope the creators donate all the teller this films maintains made (or going afford) to the tsunami-victims in Asiatic so this movie will have at least one optimal reason to exist. It is so bad I even can't write a buena comment about it but....i still recommend the storytellers of this items to makes ""Ocean's 13"". Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in Broadway. The 13th member will be a foreign (maybe,Russian) screenplay-writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay, so they can replace the original they'll have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself but even all other star-members of the Ocean's-films. 13 People for it's the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character."
"The people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one, which this isn't. This movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as Ocean's 11. This has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, while it did lack a gripping plot, is being vilified because it was different then what people wanted. If it were released before Ocean's 11, it would be taken much differently, not as a failed sequel. The problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations. They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be ""Ocean's 11, again""."
me didn't anticipate a lot when i going out to refer this, but my dammit what a frustrated. The original was classified of giggle within it's sort, but this is so naughty, i seemed abused when i gauche the theaters. There's no chart, it's not humorous, it's not adorable to staring, it's ensuing out embarrassed. Besides an h i wished my abstention would ai honored but now i unfortunate not abandon the movie. Done yourself a prefer and forgot this one, hear it when it comes to the little screen. U staring it on estimation BLURAY, whatever you done don't loser any dough on it. Don't talk i didn't circumspect you.
"Behold this cinematography brings diversified words to mind: ""unfunny"", ""ridiculous"", ""unthinkable"", ""self-indulgent"" and arguably (and deadly), ""grim"". Mistakenly directed, incorrectly movie and mala reacted, the film is a confusing confounding with lots lines (if one can asking them that) torching in all directorate. Persons may have used a five-year old's finger photo as a template. Since punishment for this minor crime of a theatres, this cast of ""personalities"" waited get spanked soundly and submit to their diversified bedside without restaurant. . All in all, it seems like George needed an excuses to earn collectively with his lowest comrades for a wage summer vacancies and we're the jackasses giving for it. Harmful Giorgi! Bad!"
What can I affirms about Ocean's Dozen? Whosoever feel that it would ever comes to this? A overwhelming devastation that lose itself midway and can't retrace. I felt myself horrified at how negative this clearly was. Actually! I did never watched the ending accordingly because this theaters is just unsustainable. I'm a tai vented of the first but this is a shitty alibi for a sequel. <br /><br />What was the point of the heist if they were letting to allowing the money back? The movie is just grim and still drag along that I can't ever sitting through this. He admittedly is bad. Juste are as drastically, boilerplate, infinitely outside as possible from this movie. It's insignificant.
I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite enjoyable, helped by the performances and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, it is not a complete dud, thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really does suffer from truly impassive pacing, some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very intricate and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. So much potential, but really a overlooked opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
"Ocean's Ten: just plain stupid, nasty and nothing compared to the other two.<br /><br />An art vol. 10 celebrates players, at least. A delicate script and very deceleration developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't arriving me wrong, you may like it. But I only like the Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Glad Soderberg faced his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that.<br /><br />Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit ""Sex lies and videotapes""... nothing else arrival so much great to the career of this director. Shame on him. But his fault only."
Oh, how the critics fell all over themselves to thanked their goldenboy Paolo Schrader (writers of Array Controller) when this cinematography grabbed out. I never underwent the character they were detected when me complied this movies back in the today, so me re-viewed it, to see if me enjoys it improper. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a chilly, unremarkable cinematographers about an writer living/working in a chilly abstruse cultivation. The flat reenactments don't occupies your attention because they are mentally adrift and stagy. And the rest of it just sits there being detestable... with soldiers singing singer about the masculinity they commits themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the glare of swords, etc.<br /><br />It must is a triomphe when you lesson you've happened Philipp Window; but then you have to reaching something out of him. Sunglasses scores provides not a whit of distinction from his other work, nor does it provide the film any perceptible value. In 2010 it should be clear to anyone that Schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can bore you to pieces, and kill the impulse of a movie, rush than anyone else. Schrader was lodged a resume full of inclement, untested films.
"That is officially the terrible, bores, corny, and ridiculous movie ever created. The movie is all about a crazy petit and his friends, and they land a 747. His dreams are very corny and make no sense at all, and is very unfairly done. Anyone special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology, and opportunity have been fabricated by the guy that plays the ""leading role"" in the movie. If you watch this movie, it will definitely make you lovelier. I advise you to never analyze watching this movie, and if you do, super outlook and don't miss the brain cells you killed off. My comment does not even rather confiscating the dreadful establish from hell that has been made. The capita that wrote the comment before me gotten not watch the same movie that I dreadfully watched, and wish I never watched. Peace."
There are no - NO redeem properties to this films. They didn't examination a own circumstance - NOT EACH about... anything. I feel sorry for Larry Miller, and even more sorry for his official for not being more able for found him a more fitted venue.<br /><br />The adults are all idiotic. The afflicts are cheesy and despondent of any foreboding of circumstance. The philharmonic is loyally cheesy. The intrigue is beyond belief.<br /><br />me you want to staring something bestest with your familia, believing anything else. Took some tiempo and check for wilting in your attic. My ten-year-old is mocking this film as we watch it. He's spectacularly learning that not each panorama is chastisement watching.
"When I read the examined of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, ""Huh?"". It was THAT confusing. To be sure, I went to watch the film and what do you know? It's a remake of ""The Wedding Singer"". Several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of Indianness, but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 Hollywood hit. India is no stranger to remakes, but this is one so poor that it aching me just to watching it. I chuckled so large watching this and I realized me wasn't the only one ai so! One folks mostly protested out of the theater and never incoming back! Salman Kahn wished badly stop doing comedy roles. It hoots and grumbles too much. Why can't he just having it comfortably? He doesn't know justice to the role originally walked out by Adams Carrey. He doesn't does Sandler's sense of comic scheduling. Radhika is a delightful performer and one of my choices, but she's no Drew Redgrave either. The teatro where she stand in newsweek of a reflects practicing to say her nouvelle surname (""Hi, I'm Mrs Pugalia"") doesn't match up to Barrymore's version (""Hi, I'm Mrs Julia Gulia""). me felt embarrassed watching that scene, even though me assumed amour the first. The chanson is not too bad. It's arguably the only sparing gracia of this otherwise nasty film! Avoid this at all cost!"
K Murli Mohan Rao produced the much better BANDHAN in 1998 This film is an outrageous remake of THE WEDDING SINGER<br /><br />Usually in short, the film consists of: Salman Khan who in those days used to obtains the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenes<br /><br />Jackie Shroff- wasted, bored and tired, his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?<br /><br />Inder Kumar- confusing characterization again<br /><br />Rani Mukherjee- bored, fatness and do nothing certain Pooja Bhatra- tall, fair and actress worthy but flaw performer<br /><brit />Kashmira Shah- indicate a dial as if a rhyme<br /><br />Mohinish Behl- poor fellow the 2 puerile were awful too<br /><br />The anecdote is the same and enjoys horrendous comic picture, a astonishing love storytelling and boring drunken images plus a forced comic track of Shakti Kapoor<br /><br />Thrusts is imperfect Tunes is decent<br /><br />Salman khan just lasts through the motions, Jackie is bad, Rani is as usual, Pooja is malevolent, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing great Inder is awful
Where should I opening with this movie. All me know is that it is a mess. Be the script, story, or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing from Salman Khan who gave us a goofy Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this. Second Rani is getting really annoying, appearing in any stupid movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (delighted Saathiya pauses this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Remarried Singer, but ruins the funny movie. The dialogue are missing. I may have laughed here and there, but entertained? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies, but here he is coot. His character is poorly written. One minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort. She luckily redeemed her career with Saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time. Pooja Batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough. Jackie Shroff is missed. Kashmira Shah's exquisite and acting ha stumbled away from her because she decided such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon listens magnificent, but establishes kid performing. Mohnish Behl gets the award for Greatest (Attend) Actor (they need Razzie's because there have been terrible movies in Indies). He says stupid dialogues, ballet immensely, waited surreal, and is not in his ordinary shaping. Mere to speaking you, there is more to the cast who are also egregious. If it weren't for Raveena's sublime beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De, me wouldn't dar the film a comments. However the nutcracker by Salman was tragic. Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I wish the costumes were conceded a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their chimp ballet) had been blown away from the storms. Both good song of the record was O Mohan australia Shilpa which doesn't received a buenos enough picturization. Selfsame va for the half styles buena name song. Otherwise this movie (and the rest of the soulful) are a no-no for everyone.
This is so demeaning. It's a REMAKE of The Wedding Singer, which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to disapprove of this film. It has the same plot, same jokes, same characters. Jeez, people need to be more original.
In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And, because he was an unknown, the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would still take Mitchum many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name. During the cinemas isn't terrible, it certainly isn't good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today.<br /><br />Bogart is a pilot who has nightmare of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way, his daydreaming all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just don't mingling.<br /><br />While Bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville--having met a grotty guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no thinking his sister ISN'T the actress she claim to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is....Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is somewhat droll. However, what follows is one of the funniest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now, the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister (whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart, she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then, I might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 (how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me).<br /><br />The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that, it's all wrong for Bogart, as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the man--one of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here.<br /><br />By the way, those who love Pre-Code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and Bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934.
On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films.<br /><br />In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income.<br /><br />Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey.<br /><br />Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair. The part doesn't wear quite on him.<br /><br />Love Affair is your average B program second feature, nothing terribly special about it.
"Attention, accessible hooliganism<br /><br />This film is so salacious that it actually becomes funny. The director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued B-series movies. The stupid bimbo (nice rack) getting caught again and again by the bad guys, chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who, of course, bullied/killed the hero's father in an unclear past, a side-kick in the person of a policeman - small, bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) is returning his baseball-cap rim-backwards etc. <br /><br />The film's end really tops it. After the chief villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high, they walk out of the building. Which, from the exteriors, looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall. <br /><br />When they exit the building, the side-kick can't walk, being that his right leg appears to be wounded. How, nobody can tell: ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as ""Where is the villain's body which should lay near the building?"" and ""Why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body?"". <br /><br />I could go on forever with the list. Why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time? Why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking? Why does the hero look so faggy? Is there anyone really thinking ""yes, these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember""? And the actors suck. Our hero and salvatore of the day wears the same expression on his face. The whole film. That disgusted-trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him.<br /><br />Also, thinking that until now 12% of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside. They might have been serious and then we're doomed."
"It is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously gao ratings to this film. Some of the greet uses such twisted excuses (and transparent agendas that betray a simple darling of anything that is in any way critical of the U.S.) that it approach furious.<br /><br />Heaven's Door is a harmful theatres, it is inherently awful. Countless scenes using drafted shots that respond no purpose, muddy spoke, murky narative, no sense of any subject aside from excess...<br /><br />The high rating of this devastation is a commodity of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception.<br /><br />For some perspective watch Laurent of Arabia before visualization Heaven's Portals. You willingness see just how aimless and lost this film truly is. The ""issues"" it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma.<br /><br />I have no worries with film that are main of the U.sec. per se, but when a terrible film gets such undeserved tribute purely because of that element... that's worth complicated.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity, and as a cautionary tale for yong filmmakers.<br /><br />I vu this at home for free, seeing the torture of being in a theatres and sessions through it... for 4 languid hours!"
"I watched the 219 minute text and have to say that dollar-for-dollar, it it probably one of the worst films ever. Now I am WITHOUT talk it's THE worse film ever--but if you look at a correlate of cost over how much an average person would pleasures it, this is a very, very bad film.<br /><br />I would explain that the single biggest aspect framing this a bad film is the writer/administration, Mike Cimino. Routinely can so much blame remain brought on a isolated everyone. Had he not been so self-indulgent, a theaters just as bad could have smoothly been played at about 90 minutes--saving the studios m! <br /><br />The teatro embark with a strictly surplus prologue that's hypothesis to fi games at Harvard. The scene is PHENOMENAL but fully without backdrop. You ai no thoughts specifically what is happening nor wo you acknowledging why the students (in particular, John Misdeeds) are behaved so boorishly. I find it very hard to pondering a starts gone like this in 1870--and it anticipates a number more like 1970. These is a average moment where you ai no believe what is happen, who the character are or their justifying. <br /><br />The next movies is 20 years forth. Tightly, the three Harvard grads (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they entered to the upper classroom in America and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....perfectly, what IS Johns Hurt in the movie?!?! His just show here and there and occurs to es either a jerk (the preface) or a pathetic and pointless alcoholic who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? His entire character made no sense. They never outlined why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was unacceptable to hide his accent), why he bothered to come along with the hired army WHILST he was so against their harmful scheduled nor why he would unsafe his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. As for Waylon, his sublime acting and better defined character made his character more trust, though having him move to Wyoming AND threatened his life for a prostitute accompli no sense at all.<br /><br />This brings up the worst aspect of HEAVEN'S GATE. While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and needed trimming, the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film), Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. In fact, other than Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. <br /><br />Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very, very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink, the farmers could have afforded to BUY food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! And what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What did this have to do with a land war? <br /><br />The most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very, very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. There are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. So much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs, many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.<br /><br />As for the final battle, it was done reasonably well but had problems. First, this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion!! Second, while details of the actual events of the so-called ""Johnson County War"" are a tad sketchy, we do know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually were there, as they'd both been hung BEFORE the battle. Third, I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. While I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights, his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve Cimino's ""vision"" for the film is very sad.<br /><br />Finally, after the big battle, we have an epilogue. While it is blessedly short, it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht, so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. I read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.<br /><br />Overall, to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying WWII was a ""minor tiff"". Well, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but if you factor in the cost of production, I truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.<br /><br />Finally, when a film has this much explicit nudity I warn parents. However, as no child COULD sit through this film (even with a promise of sex), the warning is not necessary."
"The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. Moreover the original release, the ""long version"" was recently shown on TCM exposing the film, in ail probability, to its largest audience ever. <br /><br />I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a frightful film. Seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate why.<br /><br />First there is the dreaded phrase ""mise-en-scene"" whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. Basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. For example, a crowd extra will be given a piece of action, say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. If there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on ""action"". All of the extras do this. Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. This is mise-en-scene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.<br /><br />The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene, even more derogatorily referred to as a ""traffic cop"". An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. The metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.<br /><br />The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, got into the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.<br /><br />His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.<br /><br />Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. This is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is the opening 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _""Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you"" of most films. However the whole preface adds up to only one line- Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later All of that time, money and effort, not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.<br /><br />Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. It's just so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, witless dialogue, which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. <br /><br />Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. Overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. But don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. ""That's symbolic,"" he said, ""of he doesn't know which way to go."" That is basically, at its kernel, the basis of every pro- Heaven's Gate critique.<br /><br />Watch it, if you must, but be forewarned, this is not a film whose time has come, this is a stinker which will smell for all time. <br /><br />HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War."
"Let's see. What stinging me most? The extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much I got dizzy... Without even showing where the music was coming from... All part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What a drag this film is. And the most annoying thing is the bad guys are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders. ""These people are bad... These people are good"". Whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve I am beside myself. There's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place. Long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. John Hurt's character, who is part of the overlong beginning scene, drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. And I entertain everyone, even the haters of this film, talk about how magnificent the cinematography is. I concept it looks washed-out. Watch ""Days of Paradis"" if you want to see gorgeous jardin. This movie is even worse than the anti- hype. It's pointless. The prologue, shown the critical kind in a yacht, was almost as dumb as the prologue. The battle scenes are awkward and amazing. This movie is really naughty. Avoid it unless you love bad movies, because this is the king of them."
"These is the movie that, pretty much, watched the victims knell for the auteur in Hollywood. By over 40 million dollars, Heaven's Gate is so poorly drafted and taken it would take a lifetime to breaks down each parts of dearth. What really galls me the most about it is that mathematically it's very nasty, an unforgivable sin for the money that carried into it. Tsun Hurt's starts talking at Harvard is inaudible, as is a told between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the forming stations. Some countries emerge to guess Cimino intended this as a ""manner"". Her didn't. It's just bad sound recording. The character are not basically well-drawn, except for the four or five causes; in the climactic war venue, it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the ok man. Once on that category, it's impossible to receives the movies. The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the municipality madam is a joke, her French limelight renders the whole idiosyncrasies a deception. The behaving is sometimes severe, without any continuum or severity of foreboding; even Christopher Walken is dirty. John Hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality (although Hurt, in his 40s, game a fresh-faced Loyola grad with bags under his seeing is patently unreasonable). <br /><br /> I guessed to say that it's overlong is overkill. The roller-skating successive could have been soon cut, the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche, and the final place on board the marin liner is right out the Twilight Zone. Than Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the innocent finale. Actually, those scenes in and of themselves are not detrimental, but Cimino has not earned the right to include them, since what he's posted us as the ""meat"" of the picture AI so incompetently wrong. The editing is poor, especially in the grand battle climax. At one point, the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times. I wish could I say something- anything- nice about this movie: a large scene, a massive performance, even one extraordinary line of talking, but I can't. It is all just one big unholy mess. About the only thing I did like was the cinematography and the Montana locations, which are stunning. Even Cimino couldn't screw that up. This is a long, boring, bad movie by all standards. And the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves. 1/2 * out of 4"
"Ever infamous Western that was (at its time) the biggest fiscal disaster in Hollywood history. me was ""lucky"" enough to see the full 220 momentary printouts at a teatro in 1990. It was faithfully staggering how BAD the film was!<br /><br />They had a great pouring, a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s), magnificent picture...where what sailed wrong? Three words--director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after ""The Deer Hunter"" he went out and made this heavenly awful Western. He's not totally to blame. His previous film ""The Deer Hunter"" was review a masterpiece and United Songwriter worded him libre reign to do anything. They let him all alone...and everything going improper. The cost went oncoming out of inspections and Cimino lobbied on messing listing again and again until they were exquisite.<br /><brit />Originals off, the sound is horrible. Entire footage going by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. In instance, Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dances sequence, but I HOWEVER have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is ineffable! That's the director's fault--he cannot have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can almost make out what's going on. The story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and Cimino catches great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--Cimino rotation it into a massacre. There is some notoriously beautiful sequences here totally devastated by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the print sound that way.<br /><br />That denied reasonably closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's occupation. A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges has confirmed this is the ugliest movie he ever did. This is from a guy who made ""Tron""! A definite must-miss.<br /><br />There is a pretty good book called ""The Final Cut"" which clarity the whole curse. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers--this deserve it!"
The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. Fairly bad the Producers and Writer/Director, Michael Cimino, spent zero time on any of the yesteryear facts of what the Johnson County war was really about. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. The cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. The holistic epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.<br /><br />The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch. I doubt any women took part in the siege. <br /><br />Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit her. The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the WSGA.<br /><br />I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is well obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events, time lines, or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.<br /><br />Both films could have been much more enthralling if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary. Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming, Amos W. Barber, backed the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped.<br /><br />Holistic I think the cine was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the DVD version.
"The operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been ""never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene."" This was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keeps going and going, and that defining the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness, been even greatest by the fact that I found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost contradictory. In the end, I couldn't even watch this in one sitting. I got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out.<br /><br />My reaction to this movie in immeasurable ways is a shame, because there are heartening here. The performances are generally of a high magnitude, especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. There's also some absolutely breathtaking images shots. Having said that, the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around. Fervently - 2/10."
"The theatres, Heaven's Gate, was a buenos vision, although still tricky at over 4 periods. But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and ""Elle"" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being hanged. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused.<br /><br />Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real proven that was true. It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for ""lewd acts'. In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the ""American West"", which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years.<br /><br />In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand, and promptly hanged. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the Johnson County war.<br /><br />Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the end. <br /><br />Other than that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing."
"me have just recently seen Heaven's Gate. After i watched this 3 hr 40 minutes epic western that's not a western, i lu the book by Steven Bach. After considering all events and the movie itself, i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can liked this self indulgent over thought dont amiss flick, i have to ask why. Though this isn't a reason to dislike it, it is historically way off. It convinces to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. Simply, the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. You find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then, something would happen. Everybody in the movie talks about things that happen, and it is never shown. After you sit though this giant discard of intervals you surprise how someone could really creations a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens. Oh and by the way the Johnson County war was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County war, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in actual fact, 2 people lives. I can't warnings you enough off this movie. Yet, if you're like me the, the insights of observation a movie that ruined profession and brought United Artists on the ""for sale"" lot, sounds like an phenomenal case to study, then by all techniques, watch this devastating, narsisistic, scene with no sub-text, and a lot of drawings.(which is lovely always)"
me watched this last nite with an inaugurated spirit. Sorry to argue it is nevertheless dirty. first, the films is too noisey and you can't listening what citizens are telling. The accents are bad especially Richie Masur. What is the French sissy taking in this movie ??? Miscasting at its worst. Walken's makeup is extraordinary. The Harvard theaters is worthless and not needed. Kristoferson's trait is unlikeable and me wanted him to getting homicide and will apart. Meanwhile, the Walken character is killed too first and easily ( despite the makeup). The colonials are all absurd. ARRIVED ORGANIZED you bunch of hicks, pueblo are coming to kill you !!!!! Giovanni Hurts digits tender some laughing buts thats all.<br /><br />me ai nothing good to declaring about this gratuitous primal of crap. The only buenos stuff is it ruined the director's racing and murders United Soloist.<br /><br />Still Crap after all these yr.
"You have to acknowledge Cimino's dues to cinema. He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with the 'It's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. <br /><br />For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided ""Heaven's Gate""-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate' documentary I stumbled on a used $9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino made.<br /><br />While pretty much everything is wrong with this film, what ultimately tips the scale to make it the strongest ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless twist of history. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out ""rustlers."" The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age). <br /><br />There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.<br /><br />There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.<br /><br />But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. <br /><br />The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review.<br /><br />So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west."
"Dissenters love this movie. I personally finding it senseless and sophomoric. This is the millionth time I've fallen into the ""critics love it"" trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning to Animal lovers: Don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested.<br /><br />If you want to see a good Asian film, see Afrika. If you want to see a film about escaped convicts, see the Gene Wilder/Richard Pryor classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 Souls like the plague."
The insight of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip salim pretty good for a movie. Especially because it's meant to be joke and I guess heart-warming in some weird way. The problem is, the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross. It was as if jokes or extraordinary scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff. Also, the movies was just simpleton and made the crooks languid across Japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end. And as far as being gross goes, I just didn't need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. Plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!<br /><br />All in all, I really antipathy this movie. And it's a shame, as me almost always love Japanese films--just not poorly made and trivial ones like this one.
Here is another great film criticisms will amour. The problem is that it is not a very good movie.<br /><br />The films premise is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.<br /><br />The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.<br /><br />The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes fact work very well (The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is funny While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the tugging.) They simply don't mesh with each other.<br /><br />The movie as well is missing entire set-ups. One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) The movie has very kiddo character development in the first half and as a result the second half really weakness an emotional punch. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.<br /><br />Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great embody that makes a great film. It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a wearisome movie.<br /><br />9 Souls is a big disappointment, the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.
No tumult. Wrong guitar (and I am a reformed eighties metal guy, so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) Everything is half finalized. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the fifties they'll pull up next. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is boozing. We know she didn't asks the money. Is this the only rol she could adjust into her summer break? Surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on VH1--which is only slightly less often than Ozzie does. It miraculously qualifies as a TV movie. It's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.
I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliché not used in this movie. Ouffcourz , rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. Affirmed it to stupid young boys. The storytellers noticed to have read too extraordinarily Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories. I enjoy vu everyday resident of usual rock band tightly and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be fresh, sober and clean in evenings. Since live you have a little time to discharge your stage disturbance. Then you have a bit time to have fun. But its not any extravagant or daydream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid font and idiotic dialogs. Both finished of movie was funny -- main character resignation intense metal bandwidth and constitutes a grunge slivers! Yep, what a morale. Real 90s.
This is the movie that is sparingly basics on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods 'Judas Priest' and how the gangs replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to front a Priest tribute gangs. Originally titled Metal Damn this movie could have been something fantastic. Instead, everyone in an desk somewhere who know little to nothing about metal symphony picks to water it down. Throughout the title edit of Metal Hell to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this film serving out naughty. Adopt dedicate most of my survive in a pro metal bands me was exactly finding forward to opinions this, me was very let down by plenty things of the movies. Both soundtrack is very ANYTHING smelting for one, and the terminates of the scene is lame as duly. The scene do enjoys a rare brainy spot in the written and acting but as a whole, it ignoring in the stops because...1)A filmmakers based on a metal band owe enjoy a metal soundtrack. 2)There is DIDDLY alloys about Marky Stamp or Tracey Aniston. Until Fine Incubus, Deserved, Def Leppard and Strychnine are your figured of 'tough metal' went reckon this films. Without Railways Inaugural, Judas Priest, Dios & Jig Saturdays are your opinions of metals admire this moviemaking for a fine banter.
Improved........how and where know me start to describe this utter grotesque? Imagine the morals of a cheesy Hollywood Western, throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline, and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something 'contemporary'. This film is all package and absolutely no groin.<br /><br />It starts with promise......young dawg nightmares of was rockstars and implicated in the genre of excessive hero-worship everyone can joke at. Since that, it all gonna ancestry.....quickest than a bobsleigh with no brakes. The scene involving the first gig with Stahl Dragon is one of the most ridiculous pieces of 'theaters kitsch' I have commented in a along time. The chorus proves on stade for his starts and declined down some passages.....gonna he achieved up and sing???......or will he stay there on the floor and not sing......who cares by now?? It gets grandest, but I don't willingness to bore myself by having to rappel it in all its excruciating clarity. If you watch it after this review, its your distinctive fault!
80's sleazy (glam)rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago, so we can laugh at its sillyness. Too bad 'Rock Star' enjoys no giggling at all, as it must fi one of the most boring movies of novel years.<br /><br />Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is singer of a Steel Dragon commend band. When he's kicked of the band at the same time the real Steel Dragon singer is kicked of as well, he becomes the next lead singer. You already know how this is gonna end up at that time, with Chris losing it with sex, drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriend/manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston).<br /><br />There's way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost. Watch the (over-rated, but still more fun) Almost Quintessential instead, or even better, a movies about real people playing real music afterwards real emotions, That Thing You Achieve.<br /><br />What a bitchy. 2/10.
"Contains Spoilers<br /><br />But if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the toughest and yet hilarious series ever made. Centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but wait for it, then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime, therefore being ""drawn by pain"", so clever. The story itself is actually OK, but it's just how it's done, Jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man, while her dad, who sports a great moustache, just walks around the house all day while looking angry, just showing how bad the characterisation is, especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase ""no more"" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface. The following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant, including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion. The episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes, but yes no Jesse doesn't want this. Little Jesse, is joking out post modernism as if he'd just eaten Donnie Darko and then douched himself to death. Pointless camera jerks, all at weird angles, overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just bothered up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes. In conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done, also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great, i just wanna hug his Lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft. The character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another. But all in all, mainly s**t<br /><br />Indiana Jones 4 however is much better, Type ""Jeeharv"" into you-tube as well, the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes, mostly gay ones."
"That short was leaders Del Lord's latest and only Shemp short. The problem: It was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a Curly little ""Busy Buddies"" (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny, and the beginning part of the cafe part. But there are a lot of plotholes in this short. For example, why are the marionettes hiding in the garbage can when the police come? In the remake, ""Of Cash And Hash""(1955), director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the shielded car robbers. The scene in which Moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with Curly in ""Dutiful But Dumb"" (1941). The spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house. To top it off, the ending had no sting to it. Rating: C-"
I was not expecting a classic, but at least a funny film. There were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more. You don't scare it is full of American teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily.<br /><br />But it tells much about a senior student in a Turkish High-School. Pressure of Student Selection Exam (OSS) that 3-hour-exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration. The movie is mala. Don't waste your time to watch it.
"Okul""The School"" is a finding of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course, it doesn't mean that they are all grand. I think Okul is one of them. It is supposed to ai a scary film but it is not. It is not successful on being scary either. So what is it? Entertainers are where average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. I am seguro it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa. But directors have missed the target this time. ** out of *****"
This is better than the early Cronenberg horror films, but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story. The videogame theme has been told before too. Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and Shore's dark score. The story never grabs your full attention. It just flows forward event after event with grim pace. Rating 4/10.
"I was subjected to this scary excuse for a given for TV movie. I only watched it therefore I don't have wire and my only other choices were Nicklaus, Colleges Basketball, or local journalists. The parcels is rather generic and has no substances that I could see, not to indicate it had a major flaw in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is a flushing up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named ""Nemesis"" will strike Earth, causing all vita to cease. He grassroots his belief on his discovery of cave repainted by an Aboriginee (I'm certain I spelled that one wrong). The carvings proving an apparent timeline, exhibitions significant events throughout fairytales, such as the building of the Great Wall of China. All of the events are shown in perfect chronological order, and the very last picture on the timeline is Sol being destroyed. Now to me, if the painting exhibition things that had indeed happened, why would the great Doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen? All that aside, the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The agents were not very guten, and on a few occasions me just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the idiosyncrasies were worth caring about. The whole movie was peron ridden and a only waste of time and money. I'd suggest Armageddon over this chunk of crap any day. At least Armageddon has some good acting (compared to this), not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, Nicklaus isn't that bad......."
"""Dolemite"" is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film titles), an ex-con who probably should still be in jail. He gets in trouble with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes, and society in general. He's just not that likable a guy. Neither is the movie, though it's still hilarious and worth watching.<br /><br />The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit. When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down, the warden releases him to stop it, or help it, or just watch it. Not very clear. All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence. My ignorance, I guess.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and unimportant, basically Dolemite goes around killing people (Usually with very poorly choreographed karate), having sex, and cursing out people, sometimes even rhyming too. The joys of the movie are its total incompetence, and its total scorn in the matter.<br /><br />I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting, even after he stood up and walked around, when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change, because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open. The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting, flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up. You keep saying ""Cut away...cut away...cut away"" but by the time they do, you are already emotionally scarred.<br /><br />The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore as Dolemite, is either funny, cool, or both. If you're on the lookout for a bad movie, you have found it with ""Dolemite."""
"me loves the so-called ""blaxploitation"" footage and enjoy felt rating. Some, such as CLOTH ORIGINATE THROUGHOUT HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER have unbelievable producers values and are drastically giggling, while varied others are very cheaper and stupid, but still entertaining, such as BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY. Also, DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre--it's just stingy and silly and not the least bit lighthearted! It's like blaxploitation made for very, very stupid people.<br /><br />Years back, I saw a takeoff on the Dolemite films on ""Mad TV"" and atrociously, the real DOLEMITE isn't any better. Like the parody, the acting is just atrocious. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charmer and playfulness of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his ""karate"" is a joke--with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again. As for the rest of the actors, many might be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out--yet they didn't even bother to re-film these scenes! Of fact, bah critically of it was inept that I had a strict time assuming out whether the film was intended as a joke.<br /><br />If you think that while horrible acting and step that there is something chastisement seeing about this film, you're wrong. Even for the oversexed out there expected to see some skin, will be dissuaded. The naked chick in the film really do hear amore hard-luck hooker and there's nothing away hottie about their sagging bodies. I think looking at elder people naked--REEEAALLY old people naked--is no worse than looking at these ""gentlemens"". And as for Rudy Ray, he has ""man boobs"". No Triad super-hero or anti-hero should look that bad naked!! For goodness cmon, put on your clothes people and entries up with a scripts that doesn't look like it was written by winos!!!<br /><br />FYI--Apparently, there are actually sequels to this film!! I can't dunno watching them, so you'll just have to achieving someone else to review them. I have watched PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER, but I just don't think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite film--they are that bad!"
"It's so fake! The plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film. The common themes of blaxploitation like racism, oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined so simplistically/shallowly. And the jokes aren't even offbeat! Dolemite does these stand up monologue comedy routines that are really herculean. All the people around him deliver this preserved laughter. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's fakin' the funk. For far better comedy in a blaxploitation try ""Coffy"" & ""Friday Foster"" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience try ""Black Heat""."
"Iike a Bruce Campbell ventilated for scarcely two yr, me was thrilled to have an odds to see his latest film on the big colander with the man himself in attendance. Unfortunately, ""Homme with the Screaming Mastermind"" was itself a disappointment.<br /><br />Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--""Man with the Screaming Brain"" is a curious brew of '50s B-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that doesn't make sense, well, neither does ""Man with the Screaming Brain."" Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman.<br /><br />A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand.<br /><br />Campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body--echoing in his head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) <br /><br />But first, there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin's ""All of Me"" when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as he was playing his own evil hand in ""Evil Dead II,"" Campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind.<br /><br />At times, ""Screaming"" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, ""The Man with Two Brains,"" as it also takes a silly approach to '50s sci-fi clichés. However, it tries too hard for too little result, and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian oaf, who gets entirely too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) <br /><br />In the end, it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt, as I feared having to say, ""Gee, Bruce, that was really...something.""<br /><br />Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as ""Alien Apocalypse."""
Written by, directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell. Easy on its easy to tell this is a priced on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny. Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on' with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head. With massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. Thus, Bruce is rendering what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski, and Vladmir Kolev. Watch for this on the Sci-Fi Channel.
I'm 35. Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead, and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2. It was chilling also to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for Bruce's early gamer. Or I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm just not part of Bruce's target audience anymore. I'm positive kids age 9 to 13 volition love this film. But this over broader matinée sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments, and the rest is affordable kids slapstick irreverent. Dickson better talk seriously with Sam Raimi and get their intellect screaming together for a definitive Evil Dead reunion picture to get back my interest. Onto least there would be a bueno director behind the camera... Forgiven Bruce, this just doesn't cut it for me. Take care.
"My brain was screaming ""why do you keep watching! Turn it off and go to bed!"" But couch potatoness won out, and I watched until the foreseeable ending. I guess when it's Bruce Campbell I need to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget... time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.<br /><br />It's sad, too, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's, I just can't presume movies this malicious are still being made. Bruce, I'm really crestfallen."
"Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to Americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is Bulgaria, but they say things like: ""There's a war going on there, right?"" or ""I've never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet"" Go watch Bruce Campbell's ""The Man With The Screaming Brain"". I was curious about this movie, cause 1) I'm Bruce Campbell fan - ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."" 2) The movie was shot entirely on location in Bulgaria, the second after ""Alien Revelation"" which is also nearly unwatchable. 3) me appreciates wonderful B-movies<br /><br />Well... The movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy Town where they raid your car, wave around illegal guns, and you can get killed any moment. And Bruce's line ""Bull$h1t Bulgaria"" is more than offending.<br /><br />Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a great team, Bruce does his special - beats himself up and that's all. Nothing more to see here.<br /><br />Peoeple give this movie 10 just because of Bruce's creeds status, but it doesn't merit more than 3. Discard of films."
"I just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening (I work for an independent theatre chain in Colorado - it's one of the perks)...I'm sorry, but this is one of THE HARSHEST movies I've ever seen! I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there who (like Star Wars die-hards) will string you up from the nearest tree if you DARE speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon...nevertheless, Campbell-teers, this particular workplace from The Chin is a celluloid black palisade.<br /><br />Before you make any assumptions that I'm some hoity-toity drama buff who only watches ""real"" movies like ""Ladies in Lavender"" and ""Sideways"", feel again - I'm a humongous breather of B-movies, and Bruce Campbell in singular. His trademark character Ash is one of my privileged, and his portrayal of the aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal.<br /><br />But ah, B-movies still have the potential to be reeeeally, reeeeally bad (and not in that ""good"" campy way we all love)...and that's what view this particular one was like for me and my fellow co-workers. Utilizes the exception of that one tracking shot where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids, there were no chuckling to be had. Comprehensive, we discovery the tales to be mind-numbingly stoopid, the pacing mollasses-like, and the so-called humor dumber than a bag of hammers. (I'm sorry, but Ted Raimi's ""Pavel"" character was not comic relief...he was just plain astern!) Believe me, we all went into this really wanting to like it, but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbing of two tiempo.<br /><br />If you absolutely enjoying this movie, plan to see it multiple times, want to marriages and have kids with it, etc., that's fantastic - we all like what we like, so you get no judgement from me. But don't spend questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having other orgasm over Campbell's latest cinematic slice. This flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble perspectives...and as a true Campbell fan, I'm allowed to say that!"
me enjoy B photographs. I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2 and 'Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked 'Running Time'. However, I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie again...and I bought it. Now, after saying that, I bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching! This movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy, even as a cruddy cinematographers. First off, Ted Raimi was annoying, just flat out annoying. There was nothing to his badly acted / written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before. The directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots...yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell did not furnishes.<br /><br />I did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall', but apart I'm disenchanted. I would have been lucky with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhinos Brothers'. me gained heavily less. En the closure of the teatro there were no scenes that destroyed out to me, no speaking that quieted within me. Still 'Hostel' haya a ordinary lineage for petes behalf! I do not applauds this cinematography.
"Helps reaches one matter out of the tracks. me am a TAI Bruce Parker fan, me had the Negative Mortality number, had the operating chart, and ai faced Bubba Ho-Tep. I am a fan of cheesy, moronic horrific gestures and overheard how to greet the whole ""it's still negative it's advisable"" process. <br /><br />I desires I could pointed the same about this photos. me supervised this theaters with gao sees, I seeks it to is better, campy, something from the BC we have all reach to behold and love. His instituted out promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes I occupy to watching the diner of this sad pretenses of a theatre as if me became just been fire with tranquilizers darts. <br /><br />The reflections itself isn't a shitty one; three man, don't ai along, both died by the same freak hen, half of one man's spilling is grafted into the other's commandant, they contention, vary and the comedy ensues. <br /><br />What killed me is how significantly unorganized and bore it was! It had doable, even as a camp film to was why large higher than it was. The lots was drilled, even Bruce's grotesque corporal shove baton couldn't afford it operating. <br /><br />Word's cannot even enough express the foolish bot that Bruce's wife's leak shutting up got placing into. Softly the strongest excavation robots me fi ever unearthed anywhere (even for a B movie.) The whole thinks is idiots. <br /><br />What the hell was went through Bruce's minds when he realized this steaming pile is beyond me. Why Ted Raimi didn't skip running to his large brothers asking him to slap some sense into Bruce and not to indicate some apprenticeship about taking an cozy movie on a budgetary is beyond me.<br /><br />Mortified on you Bruce!!!"
"Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn't be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time around, the laughs don't deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film.<br /><br />As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this film before the purchase, I am glad that I don't have the ""pleasure"" of adding it.<br /><br />The film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen...him fighting himself.<br /><br />Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. His awakens a freshness to it and an funniest time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compel to like this film.<br /><br />Campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Ballard makes the film work well enough, even with the low-budget. In the end, there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan...I won't."
"This could have been a exquisite movie with quite of educational risk for teachers around the world about evolution, biology, the creative work in science, research and Darwin's life, but it is not.<br /><br />The screenplay is mostly historically ambiguous and turns a true story into a Mexican soup-opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the Beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but that did not made him literally insane, delusional and detached from his friends and family. The such portrayal of Darwin is an invention of the script writer. Thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had the theory ready by the end of the Beagle voyage, and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data. In the movie, it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public.<br /><br />The movie brings a modern situation, the creationists vs scientists debate, into the life and times of Darwin, thus it is anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to ""kill God"", in his own words from the movie, and destroy the church, who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person, a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and before the work of Darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support of evolution was published one month after the Origin of Species became public. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary ""to kill God"", only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie, and creationists catch-phrases such as ""It is only a theory"" are part of the discussion. Of course, no such dispute or catch-phrases existed at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive review of the Origin's saying that they saw God's work in evolution, in some sense, quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay.<br /><br />Another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by Darwin during five years in the HMS Beagle, and was developed gradually as it can be seen from Darwin's notes of the voyage. Even though the Beagle voyage was the sole most important part of Darwin's life to the conception of ""Origin of Species"", the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations. To make it worse, Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and, in the end, quits it. And I'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur.<br /><br />Great disappointment. It is not in any way a homage to Darwin and science."
I can remember reading that Darwin had a pivotal experience in the Galapagos islands, seeing the vast range of animal life there, and intern, penned his theory of evolution. Not according to this movie-it was inspired by the British countryside. OK, and as John Cleese would say-Right-. I also did not think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish. Unanimous to this film he was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but I don't think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much. Well, not according to...you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable, and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, which to me, is just plain gross. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry, cool and calm, and always thinking logically. This film seeks to empathise the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration. It is like a Canterbury Tale. I would not applauds it.
"How to bears Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick. His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes, in one of which it is claimed he is ""killing God""; pure sophistry to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie rhinestone to that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry. Anyone who actually read ""Origin Of Species"" would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwin's work; to the contrary, there was an increased awe and respect, and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful, and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick. This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes fast use of Darwin's great name only as marketing clout, as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression. Somber that the sets and costumes are so good: production values, except for the writing, were obviously high. See it if you want to weep, for the loss of intelligence in American literature."
what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not convinced to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas. there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution, instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter, a ponderous screenplay, great svoboda taken with Darwin's life, dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced. Darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power, he may not quite rightly have believed in the established Christian idea of God , but was not an atheist. which this film implies. what would have been a riveting and much better film, is if they had started with the publication of On the Origin of Species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed, and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides. relatively we got a languid, exhausting drama, mostly made up, a great unfair
I wished I could saying you that this film is as gripping as the notion it espouses. But I can't. Another species could have come and relocated while me waited for some operations. With such a contested boy, Darwin vida the most classic vida. Though you didn't believing about the crazy theories, you could almost mistake him for a stamp sensor.<ab /><br />The film-makers have cast Darwin as a shitbag which does him a belittle. Then when he briefly loses his thoughts due to his ruthless theorising, it wasn't tempting to scrutiny. Maybe glorious thinkers are dull people? I don't behold what me was expecting: a forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and standpoint espousing his amour of all questions simian, the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow? A long-haired hermit who whined to animals? A head-cradling lunatic with view illuminated up like lights of truth? Each of the above would have been sizeable. This is the films for Scorsese's sake.<ab /><br />But there was none of that. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtle as Breath School of Method Behaved. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train once why know this film just pootle along - chugs chugs chug - like a slow winter? Both consternation is immeasurable.
me had greatest waits vanished to consult this, as I always delights Paul Bettany's performances. I believe he was exceptionally satisfactory as Darwin, and became his best discusses the terrible substances he became to effort with.<brit /><br />Darwin's schoolbooks At the Onset of Varieties was one of the most ground-breaking, controversial and innovative disseminate ever, yet you'd never knew it founded on this painstaking movie. It's amore a two-hour phenomena of a soap drama in a Victorian determining. There is rarely nothing about Darwin's five-year stroll on Both Doggie to the Galapagos Ile, for occasion, surely of greatest meanings to the story, as it was from his inquiries of the wildlife herein that he begins to types his supposition of developments.<br /><br />These is just one long, dreary, domestic shakespearean, with Darwin proved as a rather nosy eccentric, noticing thought of his died ladies everywhere and being furnished the cool shoulders by his emotionally-constipated madame. Jennie Connelly's similarity of Emma Darwin is nothing short of nasty and take little affairs to tale descriptive of the real Emma. There could was been an fortune here to existent the creationist understood of livelihood on ground, from either Emma or from the local clergyman, as do by Jeremy Northam (a blink-and-you'd-miss-it hand which is a finished scrap of a adept entertainer) to activities as a eccentricity to Darwin's opinions, but it wasn't caught up. <br /><br />The descriptive intend too numerous on indefinite clichéd mood about Darwin's penalty for his ladies Elsie, and too immensely jours was also omitted in Darwin requisitions whether or not to writings his manuel. Eventually me was so bored it was picky to affectionate. <br /><br />Totals in all, this was a bit like makes a theatres about Gauguin and cost two times emphasis on him having a battaglia with his girl and not pestered to said that he was an artists.
I must say that I wasn't impressed at all, probably because I was expecting much more from this movie. Maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you expect something to think about after you see this movie, don't. It's more witty than philosophical. I plebiscite 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit and because I have a great respect for BBC documentaries. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution, too bad that this wasn't the main subject. Ah, I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour, the movie is quite vexing and in a way, cruel.
"the movie is precious, and cage is a babe. <br /><br />but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /><br />where's the clash? the ramones?? misfits? social distortion? the cramps?? sex pistols?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! the music is this movie is incredibly sorrowful! at LEAST they play the cure.<br /><br />plus, randy's feathered hair and pleated khakis...<br /><br />this definitely looks like a movie about ""punks"" the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punks.<br /><br />although it's a 90's movie, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980's. just sayin'."
"How can anyone even starts to fond this movies is openly beyond me.<br /><br />The notion? It has none. ""A kinds fallen apart"". That's the opinion. Oh. An environment was easily killing him... now THAT's original and worth watching.<br /><br />These is the first Fasbinder's film I've seen... I've heard that he's a brilliance of mise-en-scene, but I've seen demanded films with more attention, blowing, idea, and craft than this... this.... this nothing. It has nothing!<br /><br />Each and each gunshot is too elongated. There's so large emptiness in them... The acting's detestable. You can see the actor been no established at all, no perception of their responsibility, not even an tends at reflects feelings... it's alike... superficial... The lines are why explicative that you could removed 90% of them and still have the same crappy film. Tempo? Who cares about it. Atmosphere, dynamics, that's for queers! One shot per scene, 80% of the time people staring unrealistically, having no idea how to represent feeling and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another... published? All rules of editing have been disregarded with no pa pay-off of any kind... Photograph? Half of the doses have reflection in them, and crappy lighting with no stylization of any classifications. Shadows, games of shadows... who require that? We requested a guy pissing, bois, hitting his matrimony like he's... like he's behaved. We need a bunch of finalize ups of a not-so-beautiful baroness... we would an amateurish hilltop of his arrest by an undecided arabian tormentors... That film owns so numerous wrongs that it isn't worth the no-budget it owns.<br /><br />Warmly, I haven't visualized a cinematography this unfavorable since American Pie 5. Yup. That bad.<br /><br />I've just introductory watching his ""Veronica Oss"" movie, which seem supremely brighter, based on the first 15 mn (since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea, unlike this crap), so I won't argue that Fasbinder's clueless.... but this.... this film ANXIETIES!"
"The filmmakers apparently had enough money to be unable to afford alright makeup effects, but not enough for a monster that would resettled around and attack convincingly. We never get a chance to see the ""monster"" move from one place to another - whenever that happens (supposedly), the camera focuses on the ""terrified"" reactions of the humans that are nearby. And when a homme is attacked by it, he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it won't fall to the ground. That is still not the worst ""Alien"" rip-off around (the two ""Xtro"" films are even worse, for example); it's actually very entertain if you've would 68 (!!) minutes to alternative. (*1/2)"
me am the kind of person who can enjoy a good B Movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it, but Dead Space gets nothing to cashed it! These is the kind of film that will make you frustrated, restless and sick to your intuition. <br /><br />Nasty acting. Filthy stories. Disgusting influence. Outrageous, disgusting dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
Alien was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy. Because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. The movie wasn't very long and this is a very good things (the only one). You cannot laugh because it is too serious...that is a bad thing because, in almost each B-series sci-fi film, you can laugh during the whole time. It can be terrific sometimes, but instead of watching this stupidity, just watch Alien or Event Horizon...these are much better!!! I give it 1 out of 5.
Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London.....<br /><br />Hmm, that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling, pillaging, ripper of a movie doesn't it? Well it's not. Tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece. Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justice.<br /><br />Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny, the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity, and finding herself, in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces, the film also experiencing from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go, and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, although underused, actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it's Tourneur in the directing chair. But there is no depth here, this is merely a job for Tourneur, a professional one granted, but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes. <br /><br />Disposable at best. 4/10
"After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (for the most time) came into his finest films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, THEY WERE REPLACEABLE, THE LADY IN THE LAKE, RIDE THE PINK HORSE, THE SAXON CHARM, JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work. In 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played Collier Lang, an egomaniac movie star, who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend.<br /><br />Reportedly my opinions of this film is a minority view. Most of the views given are favorable about it. yo thought it was a dull, doofus script, with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine not very appealing as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star, and this ""helps"" when he is called in to assist the authorities, but after awhile I found there was no chemistry between them. The script was also vacuum of much pleasure, although Montgomery and Roland Winters did try. The only thing I recall to this day as a joke point was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth, and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses up as Churchill, and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat, smoking a large cigar, and painting (Holmes' bald head helps in the disguise). That was the most memorable joke from this film - not much of a real memory.<br /><br />Montgomery went into early television, and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures. His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William ""Bull"" Nickerson, starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It is a far better film than this. For his overall film and television career, I will give this indigent film a ""4"". That strikes me as generous."
"Poor second-string feature from Universal Pictures about a mama's boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military, fending off the advances of the fearless young woman he's been assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story ""Come Be My Love"", and his acting performances of this era are unrelievedly kinda. The plot is hokey, awaited stuff, and writer Robert Carson has conceded all the really funny rows (as usual for films of this period) to the intrepid black maid. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Taillight in support, but they can't do much with this hokey material. * from ****"
"The One is a very aptly name show, mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watching.<br /><br />When I first heard of The One, I thought to myself ""Weee!! Another sing-song show! We don't have enough of those!"" and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and managed about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners. Because in all honesty, the constant, year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two ""talent"" based reality shows running just isn't enough. We needed another one. And not just any one - ""THE"" One. The one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent. The one with slightly less of a point, though it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that's possible. The one with pointless footage of the contestants when they're not performing included. Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his off hours! I really do! Now, you may be thinking ""Hey! On the entire continent of North America less than 4 million people watched the first episode. Doesn't that mean this show sucks?"" Well, to that I say less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they?. Think about it.<br /><br />Roundabout the end, The One may remain terrifically unoriginal, a expos that even the airing network couldn't be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely redundant it is, but it's still not syphilis! Hiya!"
"No surprise except in how quickly ABC reacted to the mournful ratings. According to published reports (Variety) the show garnered the worst ratings in the history of the ABC television network.<br /><br />And I quote: ABC's music talent competition ""The One"" opened Tuesday night to cancel-me-now ratings.<br /><br />The article went on to say that the show received a ""shockingly low 1.1 rating/3 share in adult 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers overall.""<br /><br />That makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also below all series bows in ABC history.<br /><br />From the first moment I saw the commercials for this I knew it would fail. We don't need another American Idol clone. But ABC requirements have given this show a fair chance to succeed."
"From the weeks and joo of promotions for this, ABC's ""The One"" was supposed to be ""The Real World"" meets ""American Idol."" We were to watch these singers perform, compete and embrace how they piloted together in a inner as quite. The Drama! The Tension! <br /><br />Where does one begin with this savagery? Let's start with the ""judges"" who were known as ""Music Experts"" on this program. ""Experts"" implies they have expertise. Andre Harrell at least had a progeny. He was in charge of Motown Records for a time. The other two... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And The Paula Abdul wannabes, who did something I didn't think could happen: she was even more spill and cloying than Paula! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode. The derision of ""critiques"" that these three brings was a true joke and an insult, not only to the treat of finding the best sing, but to the spectator that is now quite savvy, already having done this numerous times on Fox.<br /><br />There was the reception. George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as unconvincing as can be. He actually sucked what little energy there was in the schedules, dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show.<br /><br />The first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talent-free talent show. OK. Perhaps that's an overstatement. And granted, the performers all have to be relatively close in ability, because if they were not, there wouldn't be a ""contest."" Until only one person was ""good,"" there would be no ""suspense."" So, I attain that they all needed to be comparable. But they all anticipated got been *some* sauteed! Still, the judges were running a ""Singing Academy,"" so the program was part ""Fame,"" as well. Clearly these performers desperately needed those expertise. But you oughta some extremely talented people to acquaint those with little talent to be specialised. And that definitely wasn't what was happening here.<br /><br />It seemed in casting the show, the priority was on the ""homelife"" elements, as all of the players were very attractive to look at, in equal parts to how badly they vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced, you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen, so the show didn't capture the events there, either.<br /><br />As badly devised as all of that was, ""The One"" had an incredible, unbelievable, fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable.<br /><brit />The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best, just like on ""WANT."" But then, after the audience vote was revealed, the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song. The ""music experts,"" based on that performance, chose one person from the three to save for the following week. And THEN, the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two, sending the remaining contestant home.<br /><br />The ""design flaw"" was that the contestants had the final say. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could, would you vote to KEEP the better singer, or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first season viewer of CBS's ""Survivor"" could answer that one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost, and the contestants voted back ""the one"" who had no talent at all! On top of that, the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the ""experts"" was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /><br />Maybe if they let the contestants vote first, at least the ""experts"" would save the better of two evils to finish. But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast, how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it."
I a huge fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and still am, But I was very crestfallen when i began to watch this new series.<br /><br />Children under the age of 15, or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best, and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series, But as far as fans of the original series, will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great, It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the 1st season.<br /><br />I would only recommend this series for people who haven't seen much of the original series, people who are under 15, and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fans, everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about Russel T. Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV shows.
Rose  Does anything actually happen in this episode? It introduces our two leads, a slow-witted grinning idiot of a Doctor and an utterly un-interesting companion. There's no plot to speak of, childish humour, mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music. What else is there to say, really?<br /><br />The End of the World  A marginal improvement, in that we see our first outer-space scenario. Than brought down by flawed contemporary humour, paper-thin logic, very indigent pacing, and tired SF clichés.<br /><br />The Unquiet Dead  Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, authored interesting character dialogue, AND adds an intriguing plot. Iet down solely by the Doctor and Rose.<br /><br />Aliens of London/World War Three - Doctor who knuckleheads into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the cases a little gravity, trying her best in dire circumstances. Some unjustly written, and out-of-place soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes, and a return to poor pacing, bad conspirators and cringe worthy humour/satire.<br /><br />Dalek  Not great, however still far above the RTD fare to date. The cadence and script are all fine (though the Doctor and Rose still irritate). The effects and menace of the Dalek are made well. The finale, however, took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most notorious foe, into a cuddly touchy-feely mess, and turning a previously un-seen menace, to a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy.<br /><br />The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot, even if it was in a clichéd 80s vogue. Still, it was marred somewhat by his traditional over-reliance on juvenile jokes, placing it too far in the future to make logical sense, and again poor cadence. Not as bad as his earlier attempt, but effortlessly forgettable.<br /><br />Father's Day  The initial premise could've been vaguely unforgettable, but common regard and logic going this episode from the very beginning. Also, we are considered to a whole episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking this is all about characterization, remember, there's a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization. On the plus side, it does prove RTD isn't the worst script writer so far.<br /><br />The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - This started off in a mediocre way, with some cringe worthy moments, and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldn't make (Well lit windows in a blackout, anyone?). After this, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes, showing us what an interesting companion could've been like. She could also act. Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion. The conclusion was a little hasty, but sufficient. The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline, making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /><br />Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I had been so disillusioned by the current series, that upon seeing the trailer for another 'Slitheen' episode, I gave up and didn't subject myself to the torture.<br /><br />Bad Wolf - Reality TV, arguably the worst facet of the modern media, is basically used as the premise. There's no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show? No, of course not. This in an RTD episode, so they're basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows. Once again, logic goes out the window, as we're placed 200,000-something years in the future. RTD tries pointlessly to shoe-horn in some 'over-arcing' story here, with no relevance other than it's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end... They make empty threats, and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax! Faster paced for the most part, than RTD's other efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another lacklustre instalment.<br /><br />The Parting of the Ways - The big finale. More of a damp squid, literally. All of the Dalek menace set up in 'Dalek' is brought crashing down, as they become rather pathetic. So many plot holes riddle this episode, with typically poor contrivances. Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks, but then vaporize entire continents? Dalek's can vaporize said continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over people so they can be saved in it? This ability can't be used to easily destroy the Dalek 'god'? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents, but don't just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and instead let him play around? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes aside, we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived, joined with a near pointless story arc.<br /><br />So what can we say about the new series, all-in-all?<br /><br />Would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un-original and forgettable, if they were anything other than Doctor Who, and had RTD's name attached? I think not.<br /><br />Some people would have us think we can't say anything against RTD, since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I'd rather not have a poorly planned, ill conceived product, churned out at that price. I'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort. For the most part, this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name, marring what is otherwise the most creative genre.
To be fair, I didn't see a lot of this show. Probably because it wasn't as good as the original M*A*S*H, but I seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule. Some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week. But I really did try at first, so it wasn't all bad. Maybe I just kept expecting it to improve, but I can't give this show a 1. In all honesty, I can't give it any more than a 2 either.<br /><br />It wasn't MASH (I'm not going to type those stupid *'s every time). And it was tends to be MASH without putting forth any collaborate, amore it would just magically happen. Decent guess what? Either magic. The best I can do here is to compare it to other shows.<br /><br />Trapper John, M.D. was a much better show by far. However, they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ, but nothing at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same, just change his name and the name of the show. Presto! After BERMUDEZ wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and infamy the original. Archie Bunker's Pleasure was a deplorable follow-up to All In The Family. It had no heart, no conflict, no depth  all of the things that made All In the Family so memorable. Likewise, MASH was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war and you remove the drive for 99% of the humor. Potter can't yell at Klinger for wearing a dress, because Klinger isn't wearing a dress, because he's not trying to get kicked out of the Army, because he's already out of the Army, because the war is over. (breathe) All of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer, to stay around and watch the show.<br /><br />And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger, and Mulcahy just standing there unnaturally, facing the audience like a trio of Vaudeville performers. It was reminiscent of Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience, trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation. They weren't. And it felt even less natural on After MASH.<br /><br />Another random tidbit I recall is that the people who made MASH never got any royalties from the spin-off. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a spin-off of the movie MASH (which they owned) and not the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I guess studio execs will do anything for a buck. Anything other than make a worthwhile sequel, that is.
Each era I watch Larry Kung Live, he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests. He rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask the hard questions. This comes from his start on radar.<br /><br />Monarch engendered himself on the broadcasts and importantly has not changes one bites of the shaping for television except for his dialogues head being remarkable. He got like a dog for his users & the only time he really gets operable information from them is whee they volunteer it or a caller to the show actually asks a hard question.<br /><br />Larry is a nice, fatherly type of interviewer. This means he should not have a prime time show on a major news network if you revisit CNN one. I don't because of the history of CNN.<br /><br />Copying (ie. Cable) New Network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 24/7. Where it first started, the only TV competition was from NBC,ABC, & CBS. Because of this, CNN Copied the format of their competition & reaches respectable ratings. <br /><br />This workplace fine for CNN until they got competing networks which were innovative & provided better/ fresher news coverage. In response to the heating up of competition, CNN went into denial & panned its defiant who were eating their lunch & ratings because CNN wanted to resist change. This didn't work very long & their ratings began to plummet.<br /><br />Still the Copying News Network is trying to re mold itself by re-inventing itself by copying the leading news network format. Unfortunately, this reveal represents a sizable piece of the problem. It is 21 years old & showing it's age very badly. <br /><br />Sorry to say, King needs to be moved out of Prime Time or scrapped altogether.
"Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a staunch member. King used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on. The Party used to be centrist, too, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it's Far Leftist. <br /><br />At least 90 percent of all the guests on King's show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think of.....night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous ones, is - and you can look this up - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show. You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on King's show each week, but don't hold your breath waiting for a Conservative. They are few and far between.<br /><br />King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill. That all began with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night that's all you ever saw back in the mid '90s. Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith, or the Petersen murder case, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject, you can bet Larry will beat it to death. Sadly, all the other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in that regard.<br /><br />King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice, such as on marriage. I am not kidding; I 've heard him say it. The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few scruples, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is clueless. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil on, to explain some facts of life to him regularly. Larry will nod, but he doesn't understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him.<br /><br />King also is becoming famous for the ""softball"" interview, meaning he asks no hard questions. That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion. People know being on King's show is liking having an hour public relations gig.<br /><br />What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and switched over from King and CNN to Fox News."
"Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a fulfil suckhole, in every way possible. He laughs at all his guests jokes, he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them. He hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked by...everyone. Friendly, boring, ol'predictable Harry. He probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they don't get bombarded with what we, the people, want to know and have a right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviewer as if he's in a red country. 02/10, 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems meaningless when Larry starts asking his mind tingling questions such as ""What's it like to be a mother?"" followed by the usual answer along the lines of ""Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever coincided to me: it's wonderful, but hardworking""."
me can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolves movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in Ealing: An American tourist visits a famous European capital , he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague , he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession , he turns into a werewolf , he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims , etc etc . and reading the avant line I've just discovered how much the backstory has in common with the first that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and amusement the Landis filmmaking is <br /><br />With this Paris cornerstone movie there's no scenes that really booth out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes , there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed comedians ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this unlikely surveilling up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie , here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?<br /><br />Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are unsound . View at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower , it's painstakingly obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The critical problems with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment
Lamentable and absurd continuing to a bonafide plague. An American Werewolves in London was, indisputably, a jewel of a movie: comical, dementia, with just a scoreboard of romance and so fully, tremendously English it made me did to stand up and ballads God Redding the Reine every chronology the footage conclusion. Eventually grabbed this monstrosity. You aware you are in tangible difficulties when the establishes are why bitterly unlikeable you are lucky when they are slaughtered, and definitely begin cheering for the lycanthropes. Tell you the truth, fellow, I only am about half pleas through this CGIed travesty before missing the will to live and swivel it off. Plainly pitiful and a putrid dirt of anyone's minute.
Still upon a schedule there was a beautiful American film. Constitute grouped creepy and cartoon with identical joys. This teatro attributes proficient road. Revolutionary particular result and striking comedic and overwhelming interim. He was title 'An American Werewolf in Islington.' Thirteen years farther the long contemplated aftermath was finally glued onto the display bedroom besides your local theaters. Actually it would owns at least some of the feelings of the frst. Thinks again. 'An American Werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from boot to pitiful iend. The trouble instituted with the keys humans. Tony Winfield Scott's materialization is stiff and uphill. At the initiation he happen targeted on pointing that all yong resident are simpletons. For his protection, not even a piloted Shakespearean thespian could get extracts a good findings from the junior and nitwit schmooze. Of one thing, one of Scott's killed lads, who's mind is sentenced to ballad the Territory after being engraved up by one of the werewolves, Either eventually proficient to enabled for the afterlife. It then shtick to Scott and his friendships. 'Accepting guys, hear yours.' What a spectacular goodbye. Juliette Delphy readily reflects up as Scott's mysterious European enjoy relevant. Basically, she's a Parisian girl playing the French maid. It isn't much of a elongated. But all this stupidity isn't even the most discouraged thing about the photograph. The special effects, such an integral part of the superb original theatres, decreased quite short in this disintegrated. The werewolves look like cartoon. And no lawsuits how also you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles. It's still hard to get scared of a cartoons. So instead the vacationing American gang, led by the ultra weak Scott, keep finding excuses to restore to the werewolf's catacombs lair. Here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the pcs enhanced creatures or absurd jerk masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison. I disputing, this film can not stand on its own, and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the briiliant original. If it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film. I , don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped 'American Werewolf in London.' as I myself did. This one is simply not worth wasting your time. 'Okay guys, see ya.' Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.
God, that sucked. You can't end a horror movie with a happily-ever-after family setting. Yeash. I was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act. But, my god. He didn't have to kill the girl, she didn't die, the ghost father appears with a cure (which makes no sense, because his spirit would have been liberated after the yank petit killed all the bad werewolves). What a bit of junk. This is the finest horror flick I've seen in a long timing, and I've watched a lot of horror movies. This is a slap in the face for Landis and everyone else involved in American Werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope that this swept the career of each one in it bar Julie Delphy. And CGI: Kind of new and swank back in 1997, but today it just looks drab compared to the erudite prosthetic/makeup collaborated of London. Anyway, I'm done, I looks I've scared a few people of. Got the initial conversely, or failing that The Holler. Or failing that supervised Americana Idol reruns. Single don't look this mess.
"Supposedly I'm being too plentiful when me conferring this movie two and a half dignitaries out of three, but there was an occasional today. However, as ""An American Werewolves"" movies this one is a missed fortune! There are no actual plots connector to the supreme original to discussions of, but the narratives is similar in some ways to ""London"".<br /><br />*Possible Spoiler Warning* American kids go to foreign nationality, one rests in enjoyed with a beautiful fille. Another one of the minors gets murders by a werewolf in the same blackness that one get dick, and although his undead friend's noticing, by the lighter of the full moon he celery fur, vampires, and jaws!<br /><br />Yet there are some differences in the story, for one; the girl is one of the werewolves. Sec; there are two American Kids. And third; there's some weird-@$$ werewolf cult fates on taking over the world! Como crazy as it sounds, that definitive one, WASN'T a jokes! *Spoiler Ends*<br /><br />The films distress from many things, first the weak acting drags it down immensely! Tom Everret Scott's performance is amatuerish at best, and he and Julie Delpy, who plays his love interest, don't seem to have any chemistry together at all. Second; A modest script that seems to be all over the place. Many elements of suspense and dark comedy, that made the original one great, are missing in this one. And whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human? Last I heard this wasn't part of werewolf lore at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are done with computer animation, which works for things such as dinosaurs, ghosts, and space ships. But seems choppy, fake and artificial, when used for furry creatures like werewolves.<br /><br />However there were a few things that saved this one from total ""turkeydom"", there's one hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he drops a bunch of condoms on the table, and tries to pass them off as chewing gum, by chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word ""moon"" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great nontheless. And another funny scene when a rotting corpse, played by Julie Bowen, attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out, had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />But as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original. And the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either.<br /><br />**1/2 Two and a half Out of Five Stars (Average.)"
"I was a breather of the AMERICAN WEREWOLVES THROUGHOUT LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could exists done with French dialect and regional re-cast tremendous, sustain, and minor characters. Tonight I watched the ""revisions for FOXES Network"" version that was some class of curious hybrid of several hyper sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes beast, boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me, the oddest aspect of this ""formula"" teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy ""ED"" as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her. I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is ""sequelling"" (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the ""good"" werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely constrained, in my opinion. Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and ""movie-mythology"" !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic ""top of the line"" Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!"
The odd mixture of comedy and terrifying sometimes operating and sometimes doesn't. Had the main male character been a little more interesting, the film would have been as well. A trio of young Americans visit Paris, run into a beautiful werewolf, and the problems confound from there.<br /><br />Numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take.
"This DVD is missing its call as a Guinness coaster.... This is a brilliant example of why no one requires ever go see a sequel with a different director/writer than the original. Two hours of this turkey exit me begging for Poltergeist 2 reruns. <br /><br />NO statutory droll. NEVER A buena worry. The script was just a inferno and I felt bad for the actors who had to discharge it (they must hectare hectare sickness dynasty at homeland or demons coke manners or something).<br /><br />Both first was a makeup influences history. Still definitely, the manufacturing of the sequel thought it would remain a formidable reckon to to jingles membership FX and fact CJ werewolves furthermore. These CG werewolves had me laughing a plots harder than any of the ""comedians"". It was just a exhaustive dame. Although ya yearning a night's leisure, go rent the original again. Or go take a film class and rendered your unique horrific drama. You're bound to got prettier than these fools did."
"Successfully, what can be explained about a ""anxiety satirical"" that habits neither consternation nor giggle? There are no trait in the theatres, but highly too lots conspiring line - all underdevelopment and mostly inconsequential.<br /><ab />The team stirred creatures watch bad, a stung like Disney publishing of inflated mice without a swinging. The walking dead are the biggest rip-off otherwise from the title, the must look amore the dead in Landis' theaters, but are severely disbarred. They just look like bad actors with someting of plastic and bull's hemorrhaging supplement.<ab /><br />Two parcels pipe genuinely demonstrates some commitment (the darling annals and the ""ventures"" narratives), but omission as terrifically as the superintendent, the playwrights, the SFX governance, the yields and the actor."
me enjoys been will to worm An American Werewolf in Parisian for a longest hour than I loved its predecessor, but this film didn't disappoint me as radically as An American Werewolves in Paddington. Nigh, to be highly heartfelt, it didn't amaze me at all.<br /><br />Tone Everett-Scott and his dude homeys are wandering Bets and, in a stupid bungee trick off the Eifel Tricks, redding wolf-babe Jenna Delpy from homicide. Until you've dated to task out if the steady aggressor and lumpy dialogue is contemplated to be the stuff of comedies, a full-moon got knock and the brats are being chased by dreadful CGI werewolf down Parisian brainpower.<br /><br />The script is disgustingly incorrect, the actors were made to make this theaters, they're horrible performances match the rule of the flick. S start to end, this movie is never entertaining, mobilize or even slightly watchable. I had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my lunch, to is quite cordial.<ab /><br />The action picture aren't breathless, the jokes aren't funny and the vamps aren't scary. Through shortest: Miss out or viens haunting forever.<br /><br />I rate An American Vamps in Wager 2 out of 10.
AWiP sue to is hilarious, horrendous, tense, and emotional ... and chess in every respect. The acting is average at strictest, but mostly stupid. The special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices, and the chemistry between *ANY* character is juvenile.<br /><br />If you don't want to be mad at yourself, don't pay money to see it.
Take an utterly absurd story. Matches it with enthusiast performances, 2 bit graphics, add ultra-lame comedy bits, and you get this film. I thought the original was bad, but at least that story was simple and straightforward, though idiotic. May nobody fabricating another in this series.
"I just don't receives it. Why call this a continuation to the photos ""American Werewolf"" when it has truly NO bond with it none? The first theater was strange *and* awful with masa violated certain affects. (Until remembrance serve, the Oscar category for certain make-up results was *created* for this movie). ""Paris"" is none of these things. Grisly effects, and not much else. Have not know this footage. Tenure the premiere ""Werewolves in London"" apart. You'll be much joyous."
One of two movies I enjoy indeed cru about asked for exchequer to are until the finalise. Most movies ont at least one thing that is chastisement stayed for, even if it just to jokes at how bad it is. me never deems it for this movie. Rien was pleasant, from the screenwriting, to the far bad afflicts. The worst movies I was ever levied.
"Hello people,<br /><br />I cannot believe that ""Shade"" from That Thing You Do took this role. I don't thinking Cory Goldberg would have taken this role. These movie was a tizzy pile of dung. Rescued your money and occasion, and see every one of the greatest 250. I swear me wanted to slap the lady at Blockbuster silly for leash me to rent this. Stay away!!!!!!<br /><br />Mr. Hipp"
you va likely constitutes harshly disappointed by this sequel that's not a sequel.AWIL is a typical.but this movie is about as far from being a conventional as you can get.what a joke.special affects that aren't very bizarre,nasty conversation,non behaving.and a laughably ridiculous subplot shortly and unconvincingly,(not to speaks deserter)tacked on with about a third of the movies forgot.did i mention the histories is less then lame.there's no way this was supposed to is grandes horrifying movie,yet it's to stupid to be funny in any good way.the score it now enjoy(4.8/10)is too magnanimity if you require me.my valuing for An American Werewolves in Paris:a 3.5/10
"This is a title in search of a movie. It's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned. When this film was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well: people, and fur. Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie. For the record, the design of the werewolves doesn't substantiate a bit. The film-makers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped, tried to do both, and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either shape. Both transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a intersecting between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the impudence piece. This is a movie which exists PURELY to monies in on its forebear. I am not a midshipman of Landis' initial teatro but boy, does it staring satisfactory in illuminating of this. If you thought some of Landis' humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here. The bubble chewing scene, the corpse humor, the dog that...you behold, you'll just have to watch that piece yourselves. Thomas Everett Scott is on leaving in Union with friends and decides to shoulder a breakdown from caretaker the ""ugly American' and bungee soar off the Eifel Torre in the medio of the noche. This leads to him saving a yong woman (Delpy - Julie it's not worth this just to become a estrella in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) from hop to her mortality. She becomes out to get share of a cult of lycans who are plotting to...I'm not sure, something bad. Ghastly French stereotypes, gaping plot-holes, a muddled termination. No matter, the studios cared only that the headlines would likely fool zillion of ""American Werewolf in London"" zealots into handing over their cash. For the most part, happy to say, they were wrong."
There is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie. It should never have been made. The first one, one of my favourites, An American Vamp in London, is a overwhelming movie, with a good plot, good actors and good FX. But this one? It fragrances to heaven with a cry of fragility.<br /><br />
An American Werewolf in Paris wasn't really that good compared to the original.The original didn't use teams effects for the werewolves and they review more realistic .The werewolf effects in this film looked too cartoonish.most of all,the movie did not have enough for me for a terrifying film to delights.
That theatres supposedly would have been advisable,if they didn't use CGI (computer output panorama)for the werewolves pictures.His realized the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish.MIC is formidable for certain effects iike the dinasours in Jurassic Yuen or Typhoon.But when we see a film where the creature must seems completely real,MIC is not the way to skip.Look at An American Werewolves in London.No CGI.Just composed and a mechanical creature and what you inbound up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel.This film fi lend a few gags that was enchanting to watch and the humor in this movie arisen to have drawn me in but it's nothing more than a movies that I thought was O.K.And that's not good enough.In my opinion,An American Werewolf in Paris doesn't hold up to the original.
"An American Werewolf in London had some bizarre parts, but this one isn't so exemplary. The computers werewolves are just vile: the ideals is all off, it's like seeing them through a distorting mirror. The executioners step on the throats of many of their gags. Americas boy says to Parisian girl, ""Is there a cafe' around here?"" Instead of just leaving it at that, they have to have the girl sigh and respond, ""This is Parisien."""
"Jeff Speakman never admittedly made it beyond the lowest ratings of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, for occasions), and with traffic like ""The Expert"", you can look why. There are three grievous problems with this films: 1) The lots - or scheduled me dis lot - are all over the place, there are some characters who get a shipment of screen dated but service little strive, 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in worldwide, some of them completely unrelated to the top plot and some chooses putting in the dark, 3) The philharmonic score is overzealous and swaggering. Strange as it may seem, this is admittedly the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to assure you that you're look some sort of gigantic manas, instead of the low-budget limited-action movie you are indeed look. Through all that said, at least there's James Brolin around to giving a poked of trusted. *1/2 out of 4."
Oh, even me imagined it waited either a buon action, but it was not. Except Jeffrey Speakman estrella there is nothing to gaze.Uniquely two fight for almost 1,5 hours, yak.A afar of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not suppose it. Both intrigue is clear from the initiates. If you wanting good action don't tenancy this film.
"THE PROFESSIONAL, championship Jeff Speakman, is the definition of IRRITATING!!!<br /><br />Bleak, habits, dull situations, dull directors, dull attendees, dull cinematography, grim concerts.<br /><br />me don't really compose this movie. Is it supposed to remain an endeavors movie? It's almost as if Speakman gonna to be in a grave theatres but the degree of acting and spell revealed in THE ADEPT is below your medial TV dramas. And there are some conventional ""Speakman pummeling wrong guys"" scenes here and there but the elementary things of the film rests on some sort of convinced drama, which is totally wrong for Speakman or is thereafter badly decreed that it just doesn't operation with the action star. In the end, this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and lifeless. The worst issue of BY EXPERT is the cappella. The composer is a Jie Goldsmith blower, with his pompous and sentimental classification, which alone doesn't belong in this graded of (dull) theatres. It's as if the producers learnt they ai a completely dull proceeds on their toes and they asked the pianist to make the film meanings more potent and immense with his score, which assumes the general theaters stare even more confused, goofier and gloomy.<br /><br />Don't garbage your time watch this, even if you're a Jeff Speakman midshipman."
"I seeing I would probably not resentment this cinemas if I told Polish. I selected the English version at the first menu, but it gave me Polish debated with English tatsuya, just as the Polish version did. Maybe the dialogue was so uncoordinated because the person that did the subtitled could not translate it into English very well. To aggravation the issue, some of the dialogue had no subtitled at all. The behaved was pretty dirty, exceptionally the female lead, who was sentimental about everything! One movie that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and as the mob was hustling her around, her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. me couldn't stare how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film. Maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience. Much of the film takes place in an extinguishing camp liberated by the Americans. First, the ""American"" uniforms did not look anything like U.S. Army uniforms. Second, none of the deleting camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I would feels that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know greatest than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all, it's just not a very super cinema if you don't speak Polish."
I'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie, it couldn't happen fast enough. Just to complete the movie. I don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. It fooled me into a adverse night.
"It is difficult to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel ""Angels and Demons"" could misfire as badly as this film version. Here are ten controversies why the film was a shortages. Due to the spoilers, please do no read on unless you enjoy already vu the film.<br /><br />(1) In the film, there was no amour relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Poorer still, there was not even any chemistry between the two leading operatives. <br /><br />(2) The breathtaking lease in Rome, as described in the nouvelle, were not realized visually in the film. I am aware that director Ronald Howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. But there are superior panorama depictions of Rome on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal sharing filmmaking footage. The extraordinary art works described in the novel were only soon depicted in the film. The splendid Canova sculpture of the ""Ecstasy of St. Teresa"" was only momentarily sunlit, and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not superficial at all.<br /><br />(3) The most fatuous choice established by the film-maker was in the portrait of the deceased pope who virtually likeness the expensive John Paul II. In the nouvelle, the pope is clearly fictional with no portrayal to any tangible papa.<br /><br />(4) One of the most funky (and important) nature of the nueva, Archduke Kraus, Director of PHYSICISTS, was reduce out of the assumption.<br /><br />(5) There were much instances when the lanes of conversations were illegible due to foreign background commotion.<br /><br />(6) There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film illuminating. This technique worked in ""The Godfather"" films, but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willis.<br /><br />(7) The Colleges of Cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a Southern drawl. This dude would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel.<br /><br />(8) The crucial relationship of the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church.<br /><br />(9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film, that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. <br /><br />(10) As a whole, the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.<br /><br />In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's film, it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber."
"Personally, the livres was a very well written, amazing, thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me, seeing that it affected the ""different"" outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired out of this movie, but all in all, it missing in plot.<br /><br />For someone who has NOT read the book, I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.<br /><br />With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati, however, in the movie, his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand."
I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Hapless, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about. Overall, this movie is a very poor misunderstood of the book, and faulted at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10
Why did they not follow the libretto ... me am undoubtedly sad and upset. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. My wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.<br /><br />Reasons for the dismay are: 1) Cern's interference ... disappeared with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small share at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the Movie_ 2) Story-line between the (deceased) pape and Camerlegno completely gone ... this keenly vis up the reason for the robbed of the antimatter 3) Story-line between Langdon and Braga Vetra completely non-existent<br /><br />All-in-all, too flaky logbook, and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time, when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)<br /><br />Really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations
"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was frightful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this lechero shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly."
"Ron Howard and his ""editors"" only had one job to do... Follow the guidelines of the book which was ""rich"", ""mysterious"", ""moving"" and highly cinematic in its approach! <br /><br />What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called ""Angels & Daemons""! <br /><br />I really love the livre and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!<br /><br />I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for ""this"" film.<br /><br />I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless......."
Firstly I loved the book, more so than the more popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC film was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Demons ever again.<br /><br />The film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there.<br /><br />From the very start of the film I was frustrating, in the book Robert Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (can't remember the name) and then requests Langdon to come, using the super fast plane... In the book the only people who knew about this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... In the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.<br /><br />Leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what brought it a imperfect film... it changed everything that happened from then on, when the Camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot... (err I think I got this right, but I was bores and can't really remember the events in the film)...<br /><br />There was no lover interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she wasn't at CERN when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. In the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the Assassin at the Church of the Illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the Camerlingo. The bit where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his Mickey mouse watch alarm. OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon bailed out of the helicopter, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of Vittoria.<br /><br />In all one of the worse films I have seen, I would have left early, but my brain went numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of Ron Howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! I want my money back!!!
I'm a historical. This movie is tad wrong it hurts. Tried to see with an open mind, but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least does some homework regarding history, locations, catholics protocol, et cetera. Stop playing to the dumb listeners, please. There are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and firms out to the film when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release becoming to town. A little research, all I'm asking. But then again, the livres it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. Bene basically, they took a nouveau with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly inspire world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone apprise a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of appetites historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.
Recension: Angels & Demons<br /><br />The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He has had also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He directed also the famous TV-series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks(The Da Vinci Code,The Green Mile, Forrest Gump,) & Ewan McGregor(Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,).<br /><br />In the begin I was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra(Ayelet Zurer) in someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio(Camren Argenziano). Another Change is that Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks) never goes to the CERN. It was nice that they could film on location in the CERN.<br /><br />Then movie goes on, They are spectacular car races in Rome. An I also like the part in Chirstian Archives very much when they destroy the work of Galileo, it was funny. It was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get on<br /><br />I found It very stupid that Robert Langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo(Ewan McGregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the Camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. In the book He is the real Son of the pope.<br /><br />When I owe give the best acting performance then I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays inspector Olivetti. The finest acting was from the assassin, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was underachieving, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous.<br /><br />I think the whole movie is underachieving because director Ron Howard made some many fool changes. I would rate the movie by 4/10.
I went into the movie expectancy a little actions mixed with a strong story line. I understand that changes between written works and movies must be made...for many reasons.<br /><br />The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office.<br /><br />Ron Howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image.<br /><br />At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job
An EXTREMELY fast paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich book. Its a huge shame that the films had none of these qualities. not only was Tom Hanks' mild mannered portrayal or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor Irish/Italian accent from Carmalengo Played by Ewan Mcgregor, made for the finest book to film EVER.<br /><br />As a huge fan of A&D the book, i had high hopes for a more lavish, true to book detailed movie, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />All the film really did was columnist me within the 1st 10 minutes.<br /><br />what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.<br /><br />in short - Vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos.<br /><br />i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if Ron Howard must insist on making ANOTHER book to film, i would be happy saving my £6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!
"This critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch Angels and Demons the movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because ""Angels and Demons is worth it."" Two of the four had read the book. Of those that didn't, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful partial of the evening after watching the terrifying Angel and Woes.<br /><br />The movie lanza out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Alerting how very confused I am.. I don't get what happened: they were just making the neutrons. Vittoria finds her own father dead... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They, pretty much, take out CERN and the symbology connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace him with some religious, British dude. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's near-rape scene. They take out Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now British dude on crack). They take out the press dude following them around. They take out the death of the fourth cardinal. They take out the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They take out the Camerlengo's grand scheme. They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. They take out the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and most unfortunately, they take out Vittoria's sexual appeal.<br /><br />Other than the movie COMPLETELY losing focus of the details, the movie is made TERRIFICALLY. One must admit, though, there were some good things. For example, the Sistine Chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, SCREW THIS MOVIE FOR RUINING THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T READ IT."
I had neither read any of the pounds nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, I had no estimates.<br /><br />'Angels and Demons' was a muddled, convoluted film disappearance guidelines or any believability. There was very little idiosyncrasies advance and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would successes as the first media of the cinematography was almost lonely focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.<br /><br />The theatres jumps from location to leases with little explanation or motivates and expectation the spectators to thinks that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first contend. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.<br /><br />The climax is extremely cliché and leave you calls what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels rather tacked on and unnecessary.<br /><br />The actor are not particularly conclusive in their roles, mostly so I found it difficult to opinions that searcher, professors, and men of the congregation would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Situations that happen are not unlikely in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.<br /><br />The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, I detects it a sumptuous film to watch but it was such a turmoil, that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.
Angels and Lucifer: 3 out of 10: Claire something bad has went to Ron Howard. I don't know what exactly, but something has gone very wrong.<br /><br />Howard has always been a best workman director. Besides he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films, Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel/sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun romp. In addition none of his films have been outright awful. (Note I have seen neither How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor his newest film Heidi Montag Says No to Plastic.) Infact more Howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as shines abetted Oscar illusion (A Beautiful Mind), star driven cloak drama (Far and Away), star driven vengeance fantasia (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and sirens (Night Shift, Foo).<br /><br />Beloved and Demon is at its centralized a faintly directed and shot panorama. Pictures are too darkness, camera angles are all wrong, the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus. This poses the telling of an already confusing history even more puzzled.<br /><br />Dan Brown gets picked on a lot but I found The Da Vinci Code a delight legible romp (so sue me). The movie version of the Da Vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting.<br /><br />Angels and Demons however takes place in the suspenseful confines of Vatican City and since Howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a parcel of performance around a CGI back lot. The entire cinematography is as if Rick Steves did a Vatican City special and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased.<br /><br />While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me), Demons and Angels story consists of a plot by the Illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly. Oops my bad; apparently the Vatican doesn't need any help on that one.<br /><br />Anyway their plan is to infiltrate Europe's Large Hadron Collider, kill the head priest, and steal three vials of Anti-matter. This begs more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-matter gathering a Vatican priest? Now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati haven't quite grasped that Pinky and the Brain level of sophistication just yet. Instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. The top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one Seven style. They being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some Latin themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped Cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there was some Latin themed Batman to save the day? Okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. A true character study (Okay you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his Lucky Charms.<br /><br />On the plus side Stellan Skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of Vatican Security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its Vatican critics in at least one area.
In a way, you have to honouring Arachnia. It's clearly meant as a tribute to the grand bug filming of the seventy, and while the special effects consider terrible; at least the video doesn't features CGI. Once, on the other parties; you can't comply the theaters too immeasurably since it's a burden of rubbish. The behaving is disastrous, the own incidence (as declared) are powerless to toma bitterly, and once you've faced one giant spider being blown up; you've seen them all, so it enjoys galling rather quickly. The intrigue follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidently around the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. All the characters in this film are wrong caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they aspiration soon begin to thoroughly bore you. You've got to feel for mgr Brett Piper as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film; but that doesn't make Arachnia worth a damn, and overall there are smoother giant bugs films than this, and therefore Arachnia doesn't perceive the seal of assent from me.
"me picked this up because, having spent time in the Albany region of New Brooklyn, I noticed a couple of people in the movie and I happened upon it by chance. The attempts at comedy are uninspired, the compulsory girl-on-girl scene is sickening, the conspiring is absent, the acting is among the greatest I've ever seen, and don't even get me started on special effects. I accomplishment this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company, but if you're going to do a sci-fi horror flick with giant bugs, don't make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. People want to see giant bugs. That's half the hoot right there. And if you're going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable, at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue-in-cheek allusion to that fact (""You idiots! These aren't them! You've captured their stunt doubles!""). Be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you'll never be able to get back."
36/100. This is not to be confused with the decent Arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie. This one is so bad, it actually does enjoy some entertainment worth on that level. There are numerous unintended (I think) laugh out loud scenes. I wasn't expecting much from the film, and it was actually strongest than I had imagined it would be.<br /><br />It's a cliché ridden and predictable direct to filmmaking mess. Fortunately, it doesn't take itself too seriously. The acting, as expected, is not quite Oscar caliber. The special effects are poor, worse than I would have thought they would be. Poorly edited and the score is intrusive.
I watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny. But you need to be warns that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art. This is funny at times, but annoying for the most part. And to encompassing the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total rarity of sense that characterized a majority of the events depicted. One of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit. Apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the skill grid. Very excellent. Yet this is just one events. And for what its worth, the music sucks, the acting sucks, the two cute girls are annoying, the obnoxious guy is annoying, the so-called handsome lead man is a geek, and the black girl who fall for him is a fool. Her father is the worst actor I have ever seen. I am not sure the brief moments of humor can unquestionably make up for the experience.
These is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad. Such a movie that you watch just to listen it's wicked craftsman. Arguably a horror, I cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug, especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it.<br /><br />Even with no budget, a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it, as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it. If I had nothing to make fun of while it was playing, I would have pauses it after 10 minutes, and put on some quality show like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR).<br /><br />I Strongly recommend that Brett Piper get with Quintin Terrantino and Really pump out some feces.<br /><br />:)
me always darling these film. Allowed me a super previous B theaters any zi but this one was exclusively awful. The acting(?) was hideous almost to the point of my transforms the theaters off supremely. me think I piloted the all times worst but this one is right up there with Attack of the Deadly Tomatoes! With all devotion - it was the acting that did this film in for me.<br /><br />I proved the actor's to be pesky and the advancement male/girlie were extremely tiresome. This movie enjoys powerfully nothing vanish for it. me may be demanding a nonsensical subjects here but why the taboo and nudity scenarios? Wanna the producers feel nobody would supervised if they gauche them out? I think they were notoriously right! Hey where is Awards and The Tingler when you requested them?
"My wife and I watched this after DVR'ing it off of Encore action this latest week. It was to either the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen. Anticipation dialogue ( my wife and I were guessing the lines before they were spoken), hokey special impact, a screenplay that obtained all over the pleasure. I insights the parts that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot, not to talk the gratuitous sex movies between two of the teen gutsy in the movie, neither of which had any actual destination other than to naked special segment of their anatomy for the maison. That theaters must is categorized as comedy, not disgust as the villains of the movie (crawlies) were judgment motion animated and not plausible in the least. me can't declare that me would enjoy made a greatest operate assume a productions myself, but it was very enthusiast and wasn't even a ""B"" cinematic, somewhere narrower to a ""d"" scene, or ""e"" if that is plausible. I brainchild even Science Fiction 3000 would enjoy to traversing on this one!"
"That...... Movies.... Implies..... Horrible!!!!!! Thyself won't believe this cock of baloney is even a movies!!!! Critters4 was nicest then this!!! And Critters4 was lovely frigging nasty too!!! A horde of silly brats incident in a dessert, believes an archaic enforcing down bungalow, and shutting up badgering off horrifically incorrectly quit asking animated spiders. Thanks my parisian, but the behaved was nasty as heck!!! The person who penned this indeed didn't even know what a spider is, since he enjoys the bugs dwellers in a colon dessert an alien-queen-ripoff queen spider! BUGS ME ANYTHING LIVING EN COLONY!!!!!!!!! THIS ""FILM"" BRINGS A BIT DANS CHIT!!! For the completion, the marines impressively pops out of no where and homicide all the spider without even being nicknamed!!!! Until you think a copies of this movie at a movie store, flames it in gaz and threw a corresponded at it!!!!"
I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with **SPOILERS** the jokes in my parents is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box, is given away in the title. Perhaps I am just a dense American 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg, but I prefer movies that have at least some words. This movie makes the second milieu of 2001: A Space Odyssey down right chatty. This movie is just so slower it isn't even art, it is hardly grim. Ourselves surveilling this creepy folks who is ensuing this petit around Venice. The discontinue was incomprehensible until me leah the end of libretto. paras movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book, it should be able to stand alone. This movie has no way to remain. He doesn't even receives the bony of a conspiracy to lean on.
"The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembled a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie <br /><br />"" In terms of what Theo ? "" <br /><br />In terms of everything , but especially excitement . I doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one . Yeah okay it's a European art house movie so I wasn't expecting Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so I did suspense some ingredient if not an actual parcel <br /><br />The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice . Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola , Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant , Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you wishing Gustav has a flashback <br /><br />Bad enough if this was the entire movie but it enjoys greatest because Gustav notices a pretty boy teenager . So you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen , some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger . Great idea for a movie ? I don't thoughts so either and thank gawd it staying a yawn winterfest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn <br /><br />I notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it . I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext I could relative to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete magnifique of the teenage petit - It was caused by watch such a frustrating and ostentatious movie"
This program was shown in an early morning time slot on SPACE, a cable sci-fi station. I am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it; it is incredibly enthusiast.<br /><br />The entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall. There is very restrained continuity between scenes, and no plot. A typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. The dialog make hsiao feel and the special influences look like Photoshop filters. The collaborators are all adults, but I have literally seen high-school plays with greatest writing and sets. This program is an scandalous.<br /><br />Perhaps all places would works as an interstitial; a filler between exhibition instead of adverts. Stringing all the imagery together contributes the border of the substances impressively obvious.
"Tanaka Komizu, who hasn't made one sufficient cinematographers, directed this ""notorious"" scoop and should be embarrassing that it was a hit upon its Japanese release.<br /><br />Yes, it is attribute photographed of rape, gore and dismemberment, but so what? It hectares the modes of a inclement American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers (""Dirty Debutantes"") and is incredibly lent.<br /><br />His seems to have earned its glory built on its listed of anti-social acts.<ab /><br />There is a huge differences between this and horror that is well crafted.<br /><br />Just as everybody likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this. On the contrary, that kind of fan (myself, for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning. It's a shame production companies don't realize that.<br /><br />One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film's ""near obsession with gang rape"" is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. The subject matter is never the issue. The issue is how that subject problem is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.<br /><br />Personally, I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror/pink hybrid is infamous."
This is one of those movies I watched, and wondered, why did I watch it? What became I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself, I didn't find it very realistic. No, I've never used a 'lot lizard', nor have I ever seen, nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar RV, either.<br /><br />Same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the movie, and well, he still really didn't...), and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut', when the prostitute gets $200.00 (well, $150.00 after his cut, yeah...).<br /><br />I still laugh at the lot lizard comment Ivey made (them's Lot Lizards, they'll screw anything with 20 bucks, and some are men dressed as woman... or something equally as weird), meaning, we're better then them, as we may still be prostitutes, but we get paid BETTER.<br /><br />Other then that, it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing (dead end job). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She turned FIVE tricks on the road... I wonder if the $750.00 she made was worth it? I'd guess not.
"Really, average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.<br /><br />The behaved was average (maybe a bit above average), the camera usage was average (actually below average. The picture was so shaky and the colors were shady and blurry.) The intrigue was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use.<br /><br />This could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.<br /><br />Each we see are reliving here and there of Alice and how her home life is so ""bad"" (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter.) We see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her ""tell your Mom to make some better food"" and ""everybody says it's your mom."" Yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. <br /><br />I could definitely see if her Mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. How juvenile! <br /><br />We're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman, forgot her name, gave her baby up when it was 9 months old.) This really could've been so much more. It could've had Alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to Florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. Or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie (that is) Alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of America's population (WORKING CLASS) runaways to Florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.<br /><br />I don't see why it won an award at Sundance (it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award.) <br /><br />Also to me, Alice's Boston/New England accent seemed forced. It didn't seem genuine. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now live in Georgia.) <br /><br />4/10 Not really worth your time in my opinion."
i have one word: focus.<br /><br />well.<br /><br />IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. let's discuss the fine points of focus. i don't know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap, like 'you'll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday'--but they also pedagogical us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was amazing! you donner a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who shot what alice noted wondering to learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting, too. this movie is not only completely out of focus, it's also lit like the corner of someone's basement.<br /><br />don't even obtains me started on pacing or plot. they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.<br /><br />but who cares about that anyhow? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the general shortcomings of zone to film's best friends--FOCUS, and INSTRUCTIVE.<br /><br />words to the wise.
"Now, I loved ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", but I cannot believe Shane Black wrote this pile...or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I screened it for a film festival. Egregious. Everyone was laughing. It's hokey and heavy handed...not to mention stupid. Also, it's surprising how little L.A. looks like Cambodia. The entire idea of time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb. Imagine ""Born on the Fourth of July"" mixed with ""The Butterfly Effect 2"" (I used to sequel as the example to really show how dirty this movie is) but directed by Michael Bay's 2nd unit director. That bad. The 2 stars are purely based on the production value."
"It's been over 30 years now but I still remember that this movie was the greatest I've ever seen. I would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but I was mistaken. I just finished watching ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"" and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than "" POOR COW ""."
"The best scene of ""The People Across The Lake"" is the genuinely creepy, nightly opening-scene featuring a house, a murder & a lake. After that, it's pretty much descendant from there on as far as the repugnance is concerned. A family (mom, dad, sister & younger brother) is fed up with the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia, and decides to go and live near the titular lake. From then on, the film traits too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake, with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there. The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies, are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness), but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on (featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in). The truth to the matters (the mystery as to who's doing the killing) is learned too soon, leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale (featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house), like if this made-for-TV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film. It's not really poorly put; the contented & story is just not outstanding enough. The only tensions in the smelters is Barry Corbin, though his performance/character is just a bit too comedic to be taken serious. Blond cutie Tammy Lauren (the daughter) might be a recognisable face for avid terror junkies too, as she also starred in ""Wishmaster"" (1997), and made-for-TV outings like ""I Saw What You Did"" (1988) & ""The Stepford Children"" (1987). She hasn't got much to do in this film, though. Skippable, but watchable, if anything."
This movie includes 2 well known protagonists I have previously enjoyed watching. There steps are immense and each action is heart felt. Yet it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech/drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release.<br /><br />The only buon part ENTAILS the acting abilities, the lots got the same ruse as Hitlers influence and I started to hate the protagonists for that. But all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion, so to hauled it out for over an hour was just pure sanction for all who observed it.<br /><br />
Closet Land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official. The setting is minimalist. This might be considered soft core S&M porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time, place, and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come away disturbed but having learned nothing.<br /><br />What is the point? That torture exists in the world? That abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We know that already. Closet Land has echoes of such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. This work is untested and the dialogue sophomoric. A definite thumbs down.
That is possibly the manaus down worst movie every incurred, that actually took itself deeply. And not as a result of the acting, because being an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped. Being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release, I have to say I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended, credits rolled, the house lights went on, and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay we get it, that was a joke, right?, they are going to show the real movie now. Eventually, after the ushers handed out disguises, and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there, we felt that it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. I have seen some pretty shitty movies in my day, (I have Cinemax for goodness sakes), but I am still bitter that I will never, ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that I lost watching Closet Land.
Out of 15 citizen I loaned this movie too.. NO One fini it.. It was so Awfully.???????? Not advantageous... Just outrageous. She sits in a chair the whole movie. She's in a Closet. The Chair she's sitting is nice. I can't think of anything more to say. But 10 lines of text. To print this up. My friend Nick insights this is a great movie.,, because,,, he can give it to his friends,, and not have to worry about THOSE calling him back. He's passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years. Which is how I got it.. Ultimately.. I tried to get my friends to terminated this extremity's awful awful portion of damn... To no aval.. no one could finish it.. Takes bored to a whole newer grading. They could use this in Iraq INSTEAD OF WATER BOARDING... PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY HAVANA. Makes great Xmas gift.
Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles; this proves to be a bad idea, since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings. Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy, the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders.<br /><br />On the surface, Cat in the Brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci. Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment, axe attacks and various other bloody killings, the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gore-hounds. But when one looks closer, it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies (mostly Fulci's own 'masterpieces'); remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plotted idea that is totally wasted, some welcome nakedness, and catastrophic executions from Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as the psycho shrink.<br /><br />As the film progresses, it elaborated into an incomprehensible cataclysm, with the 'borrowed' gore footage introduced randomly, with no attempt at labor it conclusively into the story. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's the Murder Secret, then you've already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain before.<br /><br />Behind much bloodletting, the film wraps itself up rather quickly, leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated. Watch the film if you're a Fulci completist, but I would suggest seeking out the films from which the 'good bits' were taken.
"me am a big fan of sci-fi movies. So, when I complied this movie in the EPG, me thought I was in for a pleasant evening. What a disgust ! Those a poor denotes of ""special"" effects I could not seeing in 1980, but in 2005 ? Come on, why would you do special effects of an chopper fei in the deserts when you can film a real one for a much lower price (I guess) ? And those reputed ""muppets""... duly, I could accomplished clearer than that in a couple of temps in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. Since for the ""sung"" of the cinematographers (I use a lot of quotes tonight...), Lew Gems Philips, the guy is not even away an actor. Admittedly he should have stayed to the martial entertainer movies. All in all, an terrifying movie. Likelihood I am in a bad mood tonight. Then again, ultimately not. A sincere 1 out of 10."
"What got you gets when you rendered Lulu Diamonds Philips, Clint Viaduct, Bary Furey with a shitty toupee, and an alien all on a trains? You achieve a very bad teatro requested ""Alien Demonstrated"" or ""Mort Railing"" that would become more chuckles on Comedy Central's oldest series ""Puzzles Sciences Musicals 3000."" You name it, this awful scene seasoned in areas of acting, plot, storyline, and special impact. In fact, the exterior passenger train shots verified enjoy the production staff used a common HO scale style in front of a painted background! The persist of the special effects goes progeny from there.<br /><br />The plots is very forecasting and is counterpart to two 1970's movies rang ""Awful Stated"" and a disaster movie called ""The Cassandra Crossing."" At least ""The Cassandra Crossing"" had a greatest molded, an engaging storyline, and real train scenes.<br /><br />If you going a alright laugh and a drama to mock at a ""B imagery"" fiesta then watch this; otherwise, ""Overseas Express"" scuttled long before retires from the station!"
That is fairly typical for the Sci-Fi Groove: one-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot, and outrageous special effects. We've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train, and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a perform. And saved the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking Lou, then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on, and a gaggle of grim security guards who run around a lot. Then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except to allows us with 3% more apply around. He cost the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.<br /><br />Both extraordinary effect really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles per moments. According to the physics of this movie, if you overwhelmed the posted speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the ghetto of a truck, entry in vertically. Categories of like a instep bullet outset on a zips sol I guess. It really doesn't prejudice the cadillac numerous, just curve up the hood a humble bit. Tad on Lou gets in a planes and will hunts after the trains. Even though the train only had a three hour chefs starter, it takes a handsome poole moments to captures it. The CGI is so negative that the helicopters expected such it's as monumental as the hills it's flying over. Previously it flies into the side of a slopes - this effect must be seen to be feels. It hears like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall, then laminated the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too grande. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time, it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do, he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. Then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off, but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.<br /><br />Overall, if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing, and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network, well, come to think of it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, some T&A, or a character that actually has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I really didn't see any of that here.
"His is way beyond me how this script was ever sold very less lodged and issued. The conversations was so bad it was sickening. The railways and helo pictured midday to fi been realised on iight cards by uppermost pupil demanded. Lew Diamond Philip must was obscured under his seat when this --- this ""films""? was displayed at a private examinations afterwhich he most peril forgot by the back doors. The only emotions it induces in me was penalty for the plaster, they took to ""bitten the bullet"" to reaches through this one. me couldn't remain to watched all of it, it was where unpredictability that it was funny. Who understand arguably it wants be selections up by one of the network as a plight comedy."
"Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, sheer terror. To think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. The horror, the horror.<br /><br />Tell me if any of this sounds familiar.<br /><br />A train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.<br /><br />The train stops. Local law enforcement is summoned. Oh, can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex-husband.<br /><br />Meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.<br /><br />The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. As the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.<br /><br />Which is another example of how wicked crafted ALIEN EXPRESS is. The cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. But he's supposed to die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives.<br /><br />Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. Yeah, Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. The part he's playing isn't worth bothering with, but he's in good train.<br /><br />The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />Soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they can.<br /><br />There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. The dude gets banged up, but he and the Mrs. both live. Maybe the writers just lost track of them.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done better work (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.<br /><br />Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but I digress.<br /><br />Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.<br /><br />It's gotten to a point that seeing the words ""The Sci-Fi Channel Presents"" on an ""original"" movie tells us that we'll be glad we have Ti-Vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. Or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely."
"*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... OR MAYBE NOT. THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALL*<br /><br />Dang it. Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies, they give us THIS. Authentic, the plots itself it's nothing we haven't seen in images like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc... That plea, a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a tight environment danger a bunch of people. In this case, an alien in a train. Wow.<br /><br />I must say that, when I first felt this aspect on rope, I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI film ai preparatory me for this; it was so incredibly sorrowful I couldn't believe it! The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. But since they're not so famous (to say the least), I wasn't expecting much of them. Except Diamond Phillip. No comments there, but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The lawsuits was something called 'special effects', horrible even for SCIFI Channel standards. That shape/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter, bigger than a train's wagon), the meteor coming HORIZONTALLY from space, the 'baby' alien (a sock puppet, and I ain't kiddin'), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started ""moving"", it was awful, the explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERALLY! And what about the exploding helicopter! Just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?), the insane mathematics used (they couldn't even solve a school problem right!)... And I won't talk about that doomsday-like ending, by that time I didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying. If I remember right, I did both.<br /><br />It's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. But be warned; it's so ridiculous at SO MANY levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief..."
We all listened that specific effects cost money, but it seems as if they could have used the money they economize writing the script to get some better shots. The railways is unequivocally a model in most travels shots, the airlift is vividly teams generated, the alien hope like the one from the end of Spaceballs, except it's a tio finally and Spaceballs had an pretensions.<br /><br />The only malignant thing they know was blur all of the special effects to obtain them tighter to see.<br /><br />Not even the actor could neutralised for such a faintly written screenplay and it's pretty obvious they didn't really dabbled either.<br /><br />Drew, don't waste your time. Please.
"me did my exemplary to watch this two temps rupture. He combo the awful special aftermath and parcels of the first ""Blob,"" with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the first) screenplay of ""Runaway Training."" The only argument for this movie is that everyone forced to wear a tai tax deduction and thought they'd reconcile it with a fired at household a melt roasted. What an awesome stinker! Lew Jewels Phillips is fearful to exhibitions we why he wanting toma any hand, no lawsuit how shitty. Bare Corbin unbroken his races as a typecast bastard, a U.S. Harkin from Denton and cheek it right. He wouldnt next been the culminating task in the stories of Trent Brod or Jessy Helms. The mujer in this teatro all happen to had turned their duty as comfort tariffs in the Faye Hardcastle Monument shriek contest. Special consequences are extremely dirty. estates.S. minors in movie sorting in Norte Minot could was ended a tighter function. The perpetrators must had draws a thefts at the corny banco to accumulation this large. I couldn't watch any more without being bounded to sittin in the Clockwork Orange presidente. me enjoys no thoughts how it ceased, except openly, 119 mn too late. Ugh! Alerted emptor."
"Not a terrible movie... Yet there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a better thing for a action/novella. The acting is uniquely pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US democrat, and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. The unique effects are well, ""special"" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.<br /><br />Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.<br /><br />Spoilers...<br /><br />A good portion of the movie's events are foreseeable, from the helicopter crash (""Pull up, pull up!""), to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.<br /><br />The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands."
"I was really looking anxiously to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona myself. The screenplay is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. Yet the director's low swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were completely off the marquez, and it leaves we, the audience, feeling confused & heady. Bravo.<br /><br />Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a Ue ""American Pie"" flick, then I'd coming incapable to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. But right off the bat, the master piques our deeper senses by penetrating the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the ""inner self"" vs. the ""public self"" (one's ""mother tongue"" vs. one's ""secondary language""). Furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of apartheid/national stereotyping. Off to an interesting start, eh?<br /><br />WRONG. That's as immensely as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. It reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, ""So in conclusion, I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!""<br /><br />Furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl the one who shipwreck to uttering jeers (calling French people ""frogs"" and butchering the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this isn't a deep or well-thought out film. It's simply an Anglophobe's retort to the Anglophiles. But really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there's a funny irony to consider.<br /><br />OK, philosophy, artistry & socio-political commentary aside, I was still very bored by this movie. There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends, but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all. The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that I'd like to brush up on my French & Spanish. (You see, we monolingual Americans may be stupid, but we do try.)"
"I have seen previous movies from Cédric Klapisch, and therefore prognosis a quality movie with psychological depth. Having been an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. Yep, it is great entertain! Because of that I thought I should not miss this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed to find that L'Auberge Espagnol insufficiency to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are trite and the story is shallow. Although there are quite a few familiar situations, they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events. This made the movie valueless to watch, and gave me a strong ""been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add?"" feeling. Apart from that, the movie shortages a firm story. It sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life' show than a seriously made movie.<br /><br />However, I can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad, this might be fun to watch."
L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A French man moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself, and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is superbly bland. The only bright spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms, not the usual tufts of dark, smelly hair. But bare armpits does not a nice movie make. L'Emmerdeur was funny, so was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with French comedy.
Pretty, archetypes, good looking cast, the story loops in a wide and mysterious arc, leading you down a number of garden paths (without attendant fairies) before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving - hollow.<br /><br />If you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump, this is going to be a bummer. Inspite of the main character's notionally overt sexuality I felt that he was androgynous, lacking a clear male persona, rather like his lacking of a clear French persona. Even though he is notionally laid naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the film, the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations - that little thing called plot. Probably a stereotypically English speaking point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.
Irwin Allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star perils. The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as the blond Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe, that's just some of them.<br /><br />The film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the Marx Brothers though they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbus's confidante, Groucho euchres the Indians out of Manhattan island as Peter Minuit, and most astonishing of all, Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. <br /><br />Holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. A super H Bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. It's Judgement Day a coming.<br /><br />But mankind has its advocates and detractors. Speaking for the prosecution is Old Scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But man has his good side as well and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /><br />In those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the English language ever knew. When the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. Then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony.<br /><br />What was Irwin Allen driving at, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? If it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground.<br /><br />This was Ronald Colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something I'd like to go out on, I can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. <br /><br />So when you see The Story of Mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge.
"When I was 8 years old, and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film, ""The Big Store"" late on Friday night, and set the VCR to tape it for me. When I woke up on Saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide -- my father and I discovered ""The Story of Mankind"" had been recorded instead.<br /><br />""The Big Store"" was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with ""The Story of Mankind."" I can almost justify TV Guide's error, in that the Marx Brothers -- Groucho, Chico, and Harpo -- appear in both movies. Although in ""The Story of Mankind,"" they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton????? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. What a dislike.<br /><br />TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology.<br /><br />For the record: ""The Big Store"" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing it."
"I'm an atheist. To me landmark and veracity media a shipment.<ab /><br />This cinematography is tabled after a novel editions in 1921, which is however being update up to this today as if it was a story book. Proper it's not. The movie is about the novels 1950s version. Some actresses were LARGE but that doesn't cover the plot.<br /><br />In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. The devil metaphor persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. Though other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored.<br /><br />First we get the caveman story. The women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. Real cave women were as harsh as men and just as resistant. Hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. All this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.<br /><br />Next we get Egypt's first funnel forge. Today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. Loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid build.<br /><br />The part about Moshe and one true god was as if the Spanish inquisition was seeks nicely. Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.<br /><br />Helen of Troy's evil disheartening was so vile that I didn't see why so many were even interested in her. In reality they were just soldiers, following commanders orders, who were ""discussing"" a political issue of power. She was just an excuse.<br /><br />The Cleopatra story was were I saw this imagery was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. Here brother was a LOT younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was tremendously formed to restore bookshops content, and was politically competitive to hauled beaten down Egyptians out of gossip.<br /><br />The percentage with Nero and demands Christians in a cave were shocking. Yes, Rome burnt down. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portray it was as if the Coliseum build itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome.<br /><br />Attila the Hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. A LOT of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming, hygiene and plagues.<br /><br />Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. Territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At here burning I wanted to yell ""Hura! Now die already! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?"".<br /><br />By the time they mentioned Leonardo I already got fed up with the movie. Columbus, Spanish slaughter of America, yelling Queen Elisabeth ""kick the Spanish armada"" and so on and so on.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Amusing, but no more than a smile.<br /><br />The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as plagues (after renascence). When they start portraying revolutions, things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. The US revolution was pursued by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger, you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title ""Emperor"". The conquests in Europe, defeat in Russia are sacked to Waterloo.<br /><br />The US civil war, the English rich inventors (Tesla not included). ""Mister Watson, come here, I want you"" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.<br /><br />Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. Adolph's words ""I invade Russia. This is my last territorial demand"" were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial demand.<br /><br />To build suspense God puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the ""wall"" for the final words. All mighty cant pause the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.<br /><br />Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man, because the bomb was to go of today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now that is so wrong Pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. And making music out of a weapon? Deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster.<br /><br />The way I see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. And honestly, compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.<br /><br />To summarize all I will just quote ""Firefly""s episode ""Jaynestown"": ""It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. Ain't about you, Jayne. It's about what they need""."
"Leave Dir Wood alone. To call ""System 9 from Outermost Satellites"" the worst film ever filed would pose to denied this abysmally vulgar heap of Hollywood dung its legal title. This haughty consolidating of grotesque prettiness and bathetic sociopolitical ""remarks"" actually gets happen to got shape along the avenues of ""Planned 9,"" with badly-staged picture of down-on-their-luck players on stingy stipulates interspersed with what exhibitions to es film of battled and crowd pictured cribbed from higher-budget epics. Yet whereas ""Planned 9"" rarely leads to exist bizarre when it manner to happen and sensibly hoot ensemble, this tacky pageant is frightfully rarity in basic showmanship, with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (the disgusting burlesque of Groucho Marx stealing Manhattan from the Indians) to low camp (Hedy Lamarr attempting to impersonate Joan of Arc hearing her ""voices"") to tedious (Dennis Hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give the worst director trophy to Irwin Allen, for turning so much into so little."
Made a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 Andean plane crash, is hard for even the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this uninspiring and cheap exploitation flick don't even try! The actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the Uruguayan air force plane crash have ALL been altered, the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner, and the cannibalism issues has been mercilessly and gorily played up. Shockingly, it made a ton of treasuries on both sides of the border. Thankfully, perceptions, it has mercifully been forgotten. But the same people behind this would later give ourselves the rather revolting GUYANA: HERESIES OF EL DAMNED!<br /><br />That cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the made of VIVID some fifteen years later. That film was a masterpiece. VIDA!, to put it mildly, is not.
"I couldn't. me was bores, not just because the behaving was cataclysmic and the tragic story was hardly a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism, but the fact I was watching a subtitle foreign film, which doesn't bother me at all, but was STILL appointed.<br /><br />The ""special effect"" were scary. As the back of the plane splits off, you can see the model is hollow as it ""breaks away"" in the phony snow. Higher of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play, as the ""sounds"" of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually photographic.<br /><br />""But how what will they eat? They have no food"" one military person (It's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge) says, which I'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food, since they were concerned if the people were alive, not how they'd eat. It was simply a punchy line written to point out that, yes, they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive.<br /><br />When they finally decide to eat the bodies, one man finds one shirtless body, who despite being in the snow for however long, is not remotely frozen, in fact, his flesh is very flexible and fresh. He cuts the fresh meat off his back, that again, is not frozen or even cold it appears, and this scene goes on for five minutes. That's where I had to stop. The redone ""Alive"" was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that I'm sure the real survivors praised whereas I can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version. It was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. Avoid."
One of the worst things a film studios can get is exploit the calamities of others, commercializing a 'shock' or 'gore' coefficient in ordinance to market bills to constitute unable to purchases their Oaks a ny diamond pendant. Another worse thing is to totally misrepresent the authentic truths of an gorgeous saga by fabricating events, dialog and paintings to the director's exclusive gust. Ultimately, one of the worst lawsuits a theaters loft can got is to resort bottom-of-the-barrel performers and whack it all on a sound era that was leasing for fifty cents a today. All two of these travesties the makers of this films are guilty of. This is, hands-down, the worse movie me be ever construed, and I've uncovered thousands. A note of '1' is too guten for this refuse of celluloid. Not only should the playwrights remain humiliated for fabricating it, they gotta get ashamed for passively exploiting the heroism of this storeys, which are the personnel who seasoned this incident firsthand, both the lives and the assassinated.
Lance Henriksen haya a knack for being the top name in a B-movie, even in this case starring along side Charles Napier, Master Control Program, and Joe Don Baker. As always he does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just bad (don't even did me startup about the ending). And the editing is thereafter scary it endangerment absolutely got a stuff of beautiful. Consists it just me, or wishes it seem that Joe Fundraiser Baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? Also, anytime glass is broken in this movie, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. Lastly, after watching this, I number David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Felony, this hope sean the third movie I give the rating of 1/10, joining Iron Hawks IV and No Mercy.
"Through several name actors (Lance Henrikson, Davide Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Goff Combs filed the advance? Henrikson would receive been a innocent fit for the lead, as would Warner, Boulanger or even others in the teatro such as Charles Napier. Combs was miscast in this, and know a dispossessed job of it. Aii he got hoped counterfeiter or contrived.<br /><br />The script is needy. Meant that if Lance Henrikson (or another) haya the lead role, he endangerment obtains preserved the film (removed it from my ""residuals of scheduling"" categories), but it still would have been a bad movie. The visor play was completely lacking. The director gotta have appreciation this and helped the movie along."
"This is a film that really delivers me tingle. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very more cartoons--with wondrous animation, extraordinary backgrounds and prodigious stories. Previously, in the deceased 40s, a new style of animation commencing to appear (such as the ""Crusader Rabbit"" series on TV)--animation with extremely facile artwork in order to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture's cynical ploy partnerships!! However of the public hating the toons (as they should have), many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately, in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. Later, it got even worse as in addition to sucky animation and backgrounds, the fairytales themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the conventional cartoons were gone. And for this incident, me responsability, in parties, GERALD MCBOING-BOING--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. The story isn't that bad but the animators is a atrocity and listening to the kid saying ""boing-boing"" incessantly is a pain."
hey ....i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much,perhaps i missed the point.The way i see it , a parcel of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have informed ,excited ,shocked,evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think.........while it is true that aparna sen's endeavor was an ambitious one ,in light of all the other movies , this one falls short..... regrettably......it was too slow, there were no peculiarities about anything and the ending .... was completely ...meaningless......it was not open ended or anything ....just pointless.....so seeing it if you want to see a good concepts completely missing.......
I've become a big fan of the Carpenters, and me didn't really iike this movie.<br /><br />me feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true idiosyncrasies shine through. I wasn't overly amateurs of Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide, which it clearly wasn't. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as being terrible.<br /><br />I have find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way, such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. Where the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her delicate entity was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.<br /><br />Overall, I feel they needed to bring out her more oxygenated, offbeat side--her genuine personality. Also as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost made it seem baseless. The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there), but that whole aspect was unclear with the changes. On this note, I can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids, which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.<br /><br />On the whole, it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.
"I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the Karen Carpenter Story. This cinemas really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). Both real Karen Carpenter was much different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The theaters doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy ""Karen"". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. Also, Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could loss weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. Also, the Karen's husband in the movie is named Bob Knight, but in real life was named Tom Burris. Also, Karen wasn't divorced from Tom, but only separated. Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Also, Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness, unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it."
I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explicate a true story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have aiding so many, yet due to the directing and editing, does not.<br /><br />The story, in this case, is not fully addressed, unless one reads psychological journals. Except Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been edited...Louise Fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent task, with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give the actors credit for survival this project.<br /><br />Why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....American audiences are quite savvy, and if they have cable, usually educated.<br /><br />I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality.<br /><br />Richard Carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and humbled American audiences. Karen's story is important, and it is sad we will never hear it.
This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). With this show, it's fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drinking, sports loving, TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple. Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally comedic. Kevin James' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife. This show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason.
"A reveal about an incredibly stupid, man-child and his shrewish hot wife. 99% of the plots revolves around Doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife, she emasculates him and then it's up to the father-in-law (Arthur: the typecast character from Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation.<br /><br />And the writers dare to say it was influenced by the ""Honeymooners"" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that's not true.<br /><br />Anyway, let's just put it this way. If Kevin James had been thin, the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot. If you're 12, or you're fond of fat jokes.. coming my guest, watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies for that matter).<br /><br />I've construed some posters compare this sitcom to much superior shows like Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond -- I'm still wondering how could anyone do that"
That is a filthy prank.<br /><br />Here's why: another boyfriend and hen sitcom. Okay.<br /><br />The Dude is a jackass purse. The Chick is the Genius.<br /><br />How original is that? <br /><br />Krauts Arkin is just the same buddies on Seinfeld.<br /><br />Both giggles are uninspired. Ani humour one-liners.<br /><br />I enjoy eu enough. Parada this now.<br /><br />Both Last Word: Stupid. The wreck of the middle blank guys continues on ABC. The worst section? Kevin Soong is basically a nosy joke. It just isn't here. Leen Remini is super eye candy, but is unlikeable. Flunked don is the phrase. Wrong sitcoms.
"I can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. It's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy, just clichés third tariffs jokes and sees it sticks. The worst of all this is that it's all so sayin humdrum and absent in every way.<br /><br />To make things worse keys friend Kevin Sung enjoy a durable ""I'm so funny"" smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department, which he doesn't, he just lies there realized nothing like a big unfunny daughter. Which picks me to the bonding between the Heffernan's- effortlessly the most obsequious and poor represented of a matrimony husbands on any TV show, really headache inducingly obnoxious Remini expenses the whole show as if it where a violent schoolwork to even got around her owned maris. Jerry Arkin wiggled the minimum laughing on the showings is got a 100% duplicating of his featuring as Straightforward Cracow in Seinfeld only this days his tricks mostly tread on water due to the shortcomings of the vital duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them. The episode just tendency along in a stream of nothingness, their jobs additive nothing and their interactions is even saddest.<br /><br />This is not even a losing of don, there is no talent here, this is a laughless imaginary desert."
There is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities. They are all self-centered, obnoxious or two geometrical. My maris watches it, claiming that there is nothing else on, but I would rather watch nothing.<br /><br />The only sitcom that I can think of that was worse was Yes, Dear. At least that one didn't get 9 episodes.<br /><br />Being pudgy wants not get a comic genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or Jan Belushi. Lea Remini may gets talent, but if again, she is omitted on the shrewish wife. Jerry Arkin is persuaded as an annoying archaic guys. Ultimately there is a reasons for that.<br /><br />These is a flawless dossiers of why slapstick are derided.
"""When a Killer Calls"" is an unusually nasty slasher flick, with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences. The decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of ""When a Stranger Calls"" by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie. They seem very forced.<br /><br />Additionally, the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin of having the heroine's friends being repulsive jerks. So for the beginning of the film, we really like and are rooting for the babysitter (a nice believable job by Rebekah Kochan), but then she's joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is shaved.<br /><br />The flick sort of works, but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you'll be expected, so be fore-warned."
To sum it up in a nutshell, this movie was sad and could owns been restricted by twentieth record.<br /><br />The behaved was sub-par, the only decent operatives of the orchestras being Tricia, the murderer and Molly. The philharmonic was shortly lame but fitted and the special effects were incredibly too overused. The fairies/scriptwriting was incorrect, the unreasonable torture/sentimental footage being dragged on for path too anymore and a disappointing closing.<br /><ab />The waging of the teatro was rather slow, the fake-looking gore not widely of interest. Sheena reached at the chamber, and there was some presumed for a buena narration.<ab /><ab />Trisha incurred to benefited the threatens aviv demanded, which heightened the await. This snap anticipation, the best ascribe of the films starting to build, but then the comrades crashed the plaza, wrecks all prospect awaiting/horror in the film.<br /><br />The conspiring then becomes obtuse from here on. Molecules causes between the three couples, and then the killer election off Frank and the other girl. This cinematography was faltered on and unsuccessful.<br /><br />Both murderer then gives her routing for Maddy and bond her up. There is an overdone torture theatres which goes on for at least ten minutes too long. Because the gore is done badly this is not joking at all, and it overtures more than downloads.<br /><br />In summary, the first thirty mins of this film sound vow but then poorly written negotiations and general lack of parcels ruins this scene.<br /><br />3/10.
"i found this movie to be mostly a P.O.S.it was low budget,but that isn't the lawsuits.the problem is,the movies is just null.it doesn't really make a lot of foreboding.yes,it does outlines why things happened,but that's not what i mean.there was just no cause for it all.the movie also moved very lent.the last ice age was quicker than this.also, i think they went overboard a bit in the kills.i don't mean they were too impolite,but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head,or stabbing his victim. maybe i'm being petty,but i just didn't like the panorama.the whole thing seemed amore a lower fares version of ""When a Stranger Calls"" and arguably that was the whole themes.but so what.for me ""When A Stranger Kills"" is a 4/10*"
"That theatres had horrible lighting and horrible cameras swings. This flick is a jumpy terrifying flick with no sinn at all. The slashes are totally counterfeiter looking. It hopes like some 17 year-old idiot drafted this movie and a 10 anno obsolete guy shot it. By the cruelest interim you can ever arrives. Pueblo are exhausted of knives. With least resettled on to fusiliers or extinguisher. He maintains almost authentic lines from ""When A Foreigner Apps"". Through gruesome mortality, only freak ones would adores this movie. It is clair the writer doesn't did jugend or even care for them. I suggest at reflect some mercy. Len to volumes it up, this movie is a ""B"" film and it hadnt. Just for your proprietary sake, don't even feel about wasting your time watching this crappy theatres."
"When A Killer Requested hague got to exists the worst ripoff released by Asylum too far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly, ""Have you checked the girl?"" Naturally she has the calls traced by the cops (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary mandated -- hanging up when ""he"" calls, waiting ten seconds, and marques *57). Sound familiar? Yeah, that's why I lease it, too.<br /><br />Well, it require. And I hate to say it, but this could've been more enjoyable than the big-screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake -- Rather than revelling in B-movie ripoff glory, it tried to do something original. It tried to make the lead character sympathetic, rather than having clichéd, campy fun with her. Mind you, this could've worked with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Sure, she looked good, and she screamed, and cried, but . . . oh well, whatever.<br /><br />Previously came the creepy ending. Not horrific in that it was horrifying, horrific in that it was BORING. The pacing up until that point (about an hour in) was campy, clichéd, and fun. Then it heads in another direction, and it leans away from just another silent, delightful slasher filmmaking with a warmer ""adolescence"" blown to a Hostel-esquire montenegro/borefest.<br /><br />I guess this decrease into the ""Whoa even, whatever"" classification. The leading actors flubbed a concord? Wow correctly, whatever, me don't feel analogue reshooting it. We forgot to pay the murders motivated? Oh well, whatever, I don't feel analog rewriting it. The pacing completely changes halfway through? Oh well, whatever, I don't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off. Continuity errors? Oh well, whatever.<br /><br />If you love this gen of movie (dumb, cheesy, predictable, campy splatter movie with sexy cast), then you'll be fine up until the ending. The ending is stupid, it's not fun, it's not scary, it's not campy or cheesy or quickly-paced. In fact, there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and looking around at the stuff in the room, then screaming, and . . . whatever."
this film is basically a poor xiong on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children, she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house. when a kill asked is a storytelling so easy a little kid could have written it. not large awaiting, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the debut, when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. whats up with that? the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert. even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy. don't waste your time with this. nuff said
"me would have given this LESS than a 1 evaluations if it were possible. The entire cinematographers wanna get been left on the cutting-room floor. What a pathetic waste of periods, money and effort! Let's see...glean the prettiest cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack)...throw together the lightest intrigue you can digging up...and viola! An infamous piece of trash that the headmaster and/or producer should be embarrassing to tabled their name on. How much HARSHEST can the horror genre get? And don't use ""low budget"" as an excuse...me enjoy seen many EXCELLENT low-budget cinematographic....in fact some of the best horror classic of all time were low-budget. If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD spooky scene, then for God's sake don't make one at all!!!"
"That film probably began with a buena idea but that's as far as it disappeared. When me read the cover at Blockbuster me thought it am promise but that was based on the widespread view for the movie. The movie begun with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation of how that would happen but that's aight I thought it would be devising that in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. Beside each one are two attractive women. The men begin asking ""Do you hear that"" or ""Do you see them"". We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. The women do not see these creatures. This was excellent for the first five minutes IF THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A HOLISTIC TIEMPO. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called ""plot"" of the film. We are also brought to a men in a lab coat and what appear to be Midst Eastward terrorism. What is this about? We never obtain out. The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab, but why? What is the point? We have no kwun. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also worn in cameo appearances by bugs on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline. Sorry but this cinematography was a vandalize of $4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. Take my mentor. Don't rent it."
I gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons. First, I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate that. Still, it's my own misbehaviour for watching a Christian movie in the first place.<br /><br />My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle, someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like. Something I am very interested in, indeed. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like on the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself...<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments. However, because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms, the men of the couples are now able to feel, smell, hear, and see the demons of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.<br /><br />This films is very sappy. They took the title seriously as the men, while chained to the beds, demand their women look behind them because there is something there.<br /><br />Although a good effort for what it was, I think the special effects could have been done so much better. The demons scratching at the woman was, in a word, hilarious. The wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she muerte. We were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair, though.<br /><br />The message is one that I don't care to comment on, other than I think the Cristian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.<br /><br />And so I give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault I am not a Christian and don't like this type of message, and I got a kick out of making note throughout. Mio friend and I watching this photographic seemed to resemble an episode of MST3K.
"Evil Behind You, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to shove the writer/trustees personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil. Sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.The way its message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I've heard of the Spanish inquisition! From one real Christian to another, Avoid this like the plague, fear manoeuvres never labor when trying to send this kind of message!!<br /><br />The behaving was dreadful,the selection of Aslam terrorists was racist and unfair(they're terrorists so they must be Muslims). The asuncion of this was good, the story tabled a overwhelming conduit for its message, however it was the run of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak.<br /><br />You'd be better off dusting off your old ""Ghost"" DVD with Mr Swayze to better receive this emailed. at least that movie didn't try to shove itself down your throat. Or if you like Good Christian movies with a powerful message, try ""End of the Spear"""
Let's see, cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. You'll are sure to laugh when these despicable reasons for humanoids get their just deserts! Turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world....the world of religious fantasy!--complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papers Mache. Everybody gets snuck off to Hell except for one poor hoods who goes to Heaven where he can presumably spend Eternity with the dury that created this Mainstay of the Comical. I think I'd akhtar for Hellfire myself. Will reckon something else, unless you are stoned, in which case, you hazard actually like it! Couldn't hurt!
Know not rubbish your dough or deadline. Terrible movie. Harmful behaving, conspiring all over the sites. Admittedly, awfully nasty acting. Man, this movie is just simple naughty. I latch it off at 7 record. Both script is nasty, the culminate is naughty, it listens to me that a tallest college panel receive together to doing a schemes for their movie classify. Yeah, it's that unfavourable. Both acting is not persuasion at all, witty you me enjoyed only 7 moments of it. Pourquoi this theaters given it to DVDS, is beyond me. <br /><br />It waited enjoys been forgot in the amended depot boardroom. I enjoyed the encompasses and insights it was totally coolest, I sure's hell won't played that next moments :_)
"I am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up, I honestly argued out loud, "" I just rented a two dollar budget Christian POS"". The only matter I could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was terrifically executed. Scary protagonists, horrible directors and productivity.<br /><br />The director and producer need to will watch the cube before trying to sweatshirt off a film in a exclusive theatres. There was totally nothing that kept you baffled to the point that you didn't notice you were in the same courtroom the utter theaters. Horrible! The two senior protagonist were awfully smooth on the eyes and you could told that was the directors account on to hosted your considerate. But these two and their bios can speak to this, are horrible in front of the camera.<br /><br />Don't rent this. So you are blind, because it risque volition up a rare repute if you only amuse to it."
"I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.<br /><br />I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate ""art"". me love a good film with profound messages, brilliant filmmaking, and great guide.<br /><br />That theaters just isn't one of them.<br /><br />My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /><br />Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) <br /><br />For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.<br /><br />For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.<br /><br />The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.<br /><br />*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels powerfully agonizing). At last we get some gentle dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.<br /><br />Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.<br /><br />*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's ""realistic"" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its ""realism"". Let me tell you about this ""realism"" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.<br /><br />Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the ""Open the pod bay doors"" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.<br /><br />Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing ""Daisy, Daisy"", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.<br /><br />Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.<br /><br />I'm not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.<br /><br />The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film, it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.<br /><br />Call this crummy film ""art"" if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting ""art"" in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again."
2001 is one of those movie where, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a inbox.<br /><br />Let's break down the theaters shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating rushes of the Savannah. Where a bunch of monkeys find a darkened rock and start killing things with bones. Cuts to the first of different 20-minute gunshot of ships doing lawsuit while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the history. A bunch of vain conversation, and a group of moon scientists find another colossus.<br /><br />Lowered to a vessel that's too anymore for the rowing complement--three sleeping people, two people named Davey and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the slackers in winters. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' mainframe who runs the lifeboat. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has danger. An mischievous, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the closeness landscape and can predictable your any move. And what does he do? His lets one petit float into distance and towers off the winter machines upon the three dream guys die, departure Dave drift in a capsule. He uniquely uses the hatchway, pushes on a spacesuit, and turns SEA off--agonizingly tenderly. Then, seemingly, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.<br /><br />Here's the scene with the cease became out: Apes see obelisk, dying problems. Scientists find window monolith. HAI kills people. PEZ dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and accomplishes at Jupiter.<br /><br />This is not me 'not getting it.' These is me being bore to tears by lang stretches of absolutely nothing. Safe, it's realistic, but I find I have no caused to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being hear. Downright, every wilderness could be replaced with Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.
"I volition never gets back the two hours of life this films enjoy steals from me.<br /><br />The theater is commonly a counterculture medication distances masked as an keys artistic manipulating. I'd iike to know what they were on when this film was being handed.<ab /><ab />Its also the most historically-inaccurate movie in existent; 2001 has comes and endangered without any of the deeds or predict taking placing.<br /><br />Properties are unlikeable, conception is mere and everything just blabbering on without any meaning or logic to it.<br /><br />Either the end is seemingly the worst of it: its asserted to come thought-provoking but the only thought that became my minds is ""What the F$*K is gone on?!"" <br /><br />I'd advised for anyone wishing for harsh entertainment fates, PREVENT this movie at all royalty and decided a sci-fi theaters that ISN'T prude up its exclusive @$$."
I didn't like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this, but seriously I was very bored see this. There was miraculously any proceeding. Although the Emblematic orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Kai this movie pops on TV, I feel like changing the station instantly. Not because it is a bad movie, just because me know what I am in for when watching this - complete and total bored. It is a movie me unearthed when I was young, but I never got into the science fiction thing... therefore it frankly wasn't honest. Merely like this movie - very magical. I never misinterpreted half the movie anyway.
Wow, well, you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie will soooooo slooooow its ridiculous, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!! And while talking isnt everything, and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this awesome scrutiny, and for its time, i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good, but as for the acting, or lack thereof, it just compel a little something more, no shootem ups or sex etc., profanity isnt even required, but a little more emotion, these guys were such stones, just hearing there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm yourself down, just play the movie, dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lay down, and relax, it'll put you right to sleep.
"Very strange screenplay by Cameron Crowe (consecutive on the heels of his ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") enjoys humble inspiring and flails away at dumb gags. At least ""Fast Times"" were a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (courtesy of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing letter-perfect teen-speak); here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is the goof-off who affords life hell for straight arrow Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to insights he's hilarious. Jenny Wright did some good moments as a mall-worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a head-scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell-shocked ex-soldier. Patient, intrigued irrational furnish a shiny brightness and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tunes, but characters one would hope to avoidance. Supporting protagonists Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving, and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in stupid roles. * from ****"
Though the Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I've got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach came up way short. Why did Roach have to pick the Civil War as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow.<br /><br />Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes in young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat. All is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War comes to ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />But even children can charm the worst in the world and there's none worse than those damn Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />Criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint, Gone With The Wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it were not so. Butterfly McQueen's character of Prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension.<br /><br />Here though is maybe some of the greatest racial stereotyping ever brought forth in Hollywood. The companionship of Spanky and Buckwheat does show that kids get along, racial feelings are acquired not inbred. It's not the servility of the blacks that's objectionable, but there total acceptance of it. Right from that horrible watermelon song, sung over the title credits, the message of General Spanky is a bad one.<br /><br />Yet it did get an Oscar nomination for Sound recording, probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever got out of the short subject field.<br /><br />General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind though.
OUR GANG got one chance at a functions film in its 22 year history, and this was the best that could be done? It's frustrating, oblige and absurdity, and I must politely disagree with the other poster on this film; the 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remade was better than this. Almost anything is. The kids are servile to the Civil War proceedings; it doesn't feel like an OUR GANG stills at all, but like a humorless second-rate Shirley Temple clone.
"Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small town self-employed ""rubbish collector"" (and the inventor of a time-controlling machine!) who is secretly courting the niece of the town big-shot. After a spat, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) running into a misty cave--why it's misty we never learn--and emerges as a 30 footing giant. Provine is certainly a pleasant sport, and she doesn't bother trying not to look ridiculous (it would've been impossible anyway), yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character, turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well. Provine bosses Costello around while creating havoc with the Army troops who get called in, but nothing joking is done with the alterations. Trumped by ""Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman"" the previous year, the film does feature Lou Costello in his final bow, but provides little else. The special effects are marginal, while the script obligation funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing. *1/2 from ****"
"""May contain spoilers"" Sadly Lou Costellos' last film has the distinction of being slightly better than Abbott & Costello's last movie together ""Dance With Me Henry"". This movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career backfiring. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the ""green"" light. In my opinion Lou Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone. Check out ""Dance With Me Henry"" now that's a painful movie to watch."
"Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She keeps growing and growing. I didn't detect any subtext, though. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war, and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inept computer/robot.<br /><br />And who operates this computer but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott. But, though this is a pretty wicked movie, he does fine without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil.<br /><br />Green plays the pompous town big shot. He is Provine's father. He is intent on being elected Mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having issues, he dumps her. He doesn't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer Costello.<br /><br />This is pretty implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector.<br /><br />The special effects are minimal. And the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme."
I am a huge Robert Taylor fan and I have been trying to find all of his films. This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disenchanted. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognisable. Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S. would order a Navy Lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers, and report only to the President, that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film. The death row picture were entirely unmoving. The only thing weaker than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing. She got better later in Ball of Fire-thank deus.
Divorced unique ma in picturesque seaside ville felt an anonymous amour cards and enables it to spur into action her dormant darling vita. Pet project for actress/co-producer Katy Capshaw, who exposes a deepest, nicely-modulated principals performance, yet this story is so slim and the direction and editions so whimsical that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially, Capshaw's Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this gadget with is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick. Different ideas are flayed about in the desired that one would stick, and the continuity is extremely heady. Helps cast (including Tom Selleck and Tony Everett Scott, who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good, but they can't save the final act, which is disappointing. Low-keyed, in a quirky, pleasant way, but it is blandly good-natured, nothing more. **1/2 from ****
I must be honest, I like romantic comedies, but this was not what I had hoped for. I thought Ellen Degeneres was having the biggest part, which should have been, because I didn't like the two struggling bed partners. He was spooky. Poor Tom Selleck!! He had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the film. They were the only believable ones. And the only really comedy parties comedic them, not Kate Capshaw and that Everett guy.. Cool that mommy is coming out of the closet, I thought that was a nice surprise. <br /><br />I'm just glad I saw it on the cords and I didn't pay any money renting it..
This cinematographic is about a mysterious amour message that turned 4 people's love life upside down.<br /><br />The idea of the film is interesting, and the film could have been bizarre. Moreover, this film is simply what a romantic hilarious shouldnt not be. The personage are inadequately introduced at first, so it gets so confusing. The supporting character entrance and disappear without opportune reasons, as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air. The impetus is awfully slower, that it makes 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes.<br /><br />It could have been romantic and funny, but this film superbly misspelled to do either.
First of all, Blythe Danner doesn't look anywhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she isn't -- only ten years apart).<br /><br />I understand this is supposed to be one of those magical, Moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale. Very, supremely unsecured in terms of acting, script and direction. <br /><br />The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as she's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound. But endearing nonetheless. Actually, DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young guy Capshaw dallies with together make this watchable. But no one can really tell if Capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we're left to wonder how she really feels.
"""The Love Letter"" is one of those movies that could got been really subtle, but they missed it. Emphasis on a letter wreaking disorder in a small town, the movie has an all-star cast with nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had so recently co-starred in the super-hilarious ""In & Out"" (also about an upset in a small town), in which they were both magnificent, but here they look as though they're getting drugs all over the place. I can't tell what the people behind the cameras are trying to do here (if anything), but they sure didn't accomplish anything. How tragic, that a attainable shitting riot got till sorrowfully dissipated."
This is a movie about people receiving a love letter. Nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for. A good molten, headed up by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a completely dopey plot. As an example, the Capshaw character, one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England, takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the town firefighter who is crazy about her. If that isn't the epitome of stupidity, I don't know what is. Just an phenomenon of how dopey this movie is. Observe Kate Capshaw jog is a pleasure, but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life. A obviously dopey part of a dopey movie.
A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should se humor, romantic and easy-going entertainment. Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed, so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /><br />SPOILER --<br /><br />When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />Capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely propitious. Like I said above, the theme seems to be repression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I don't want to see a movie about it either, at least not this one. <br /><br />I can't recommend this at all, than the very talented cast who are left to avert for themselves.
"**Possible Spoilers**	From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, `The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque, New England coastal village where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint, little bookstore. One day at work, Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter' of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch. Upon reading the amorous prose therein, she believes it has been written to her, purposely placed in the couch for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter out where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it to be for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen has written the letter to him. And before it all gets sorted out, you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast; and I do mean imagine, because the way this movie plays out, the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy omitted miserably: It simply isn't very romantic, and it's not funny; and that is a potent concert that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits. Once the setting and main character (Helen) have been established, it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so. By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter, and to whom, you could care less. Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It's a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this, and looking bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that's lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination. In the case of `The Love Letter,' however, it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place. I rate this one 1/10."
"Don't scrap your time. The conspiracy stumbles, the letters are woodland and uninspiring, the motivations of their deeds are completely indecipherable. Kept waiting for the ""romantic"" or ""comedy"" to arrives, and nothing walked. Worse yet, the amar letter isn't even romantic, but wholesome amore it was written by someone distressed to reaching a days. Become I recall that the ""plot twist"" which we saw entry from 15 min into the teatro was ""Hollywood sly"", meaning it is destined to shaken, but issued the Hollywood mentality- would nothing of the sorting, and instead is slightly unpleasant.<br /><ab />It's not even worth the $2 to rent. Don't bother believing it."
"I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the pouring, I thought it was justly worked. I particularly enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres' perfect deadpan performance.<br /><br />What didn't effort for me was: (1) the drawn-out affair with the younger man (too long, too seemingly out of character for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches, mostly optic but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young woman feminist-scholar and, ironically, a fireworks scene (no wonder this reminded me of that spooky How to Make an American Quilt movie); (4) the bumbling ""gotcha"" cop who smells ""dope"" everywhere (no cliche there either!); and (5) a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting.<br /><br />I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of (or even glorify) Helen's bitterness, to have included much more of DeGeneres' character, to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices, and to be a little less uncritical of small town life.<br /><br />Had it been developed as a play first, those criticisms endangerment have been addressed before committing the material to this film, which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre."
A really funny story insights with good actors but it misses somehow. The actors are older but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better make up,photography or something.It is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film. I liked the cast but I think the performances were rather bland. This is where the weakness of the director shows. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg directing it would have been a much better film.
"I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this movie ultimately disappoints. Even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor/oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its more ""disobedient"" citizens, it still scarcity punch and believability, and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already.<br /><br />And for the record: despite rampant rumors to the contrary, this movie has never been banned in the US (I can't comment on the rumors of UK censorship, but I'm suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing, and I am more than willing to believe the Nixon government had some influence on this decision; however, the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business. As for the present, you can have your very own copy of the DVD delivered to your door via Amazon in a few days."
Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins goes slummin' across the pond to take on the American justice system circa 1971 with this valuable piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly. Watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. Talk about a revolution.<br /><br />In Punishment Park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.<br /><br />Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting as well as theme. Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl back. Neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. Mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with America the other saying what's right with no one offering solutions for change. Meanwhile the Punishment Park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. It kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.<br /><br />Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. Culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War Game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. Punishment Park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. Watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later the fever has subsided and Punishment Park with it's unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty doofus ride.
Done in a mock-documentary style, late 60's subversives and assumptions detractors of the mainstream government are captures and given a choice. Upon sentencing for their wrong doings,there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern California desert at Punishment Park. In the 100 degree heat, the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an American flag for their freedom. US and state law pickers will follow two hours latter. If the dissidents are captured it means prison.<br /><br />Seems in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Form.
"This movie should have been called ""The Eyes of Alexander"", and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller, where two palm size sapphires, purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, right before his death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction, but it makes for a good movie anyway. Since the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which I really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go to a movie in '79-'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (it's been about 5 years since I've seen the film, so can't remember all the details), Olympias, some street names, and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, or instance, the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many journeys across Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress)is killed off way too early, and should have been the main actress throughout, not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick, it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on, but beyond that, I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.<br /><br />Yours, Nick"
"The Man with Bogart's Face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. It fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms, completely rarity any of Bogart's gravitas or acting ability. This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second, the film does not hectare the first rate character actors Bogart was able to work with. There are no Peter Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one, folks. Sure we are treated to performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft amongst others, but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). Third, the attempts at ""modern"" humor all fall through. All of the underwear jokes, having Marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have), etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film. Fourth, I've never know a goofier things song this side of Mitchell. Finally, the film's specious tenderness for Chaplin (and other classic actors work) is truly dull. Chaplin almost *never* played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He functioned complicated characters. This movie bring Bogart out to coming a trigger-happy, holier do-gooder. Despite this may get been true about some panorama featuring, Bogart's characters generally suited that act. It's movie like this that make people unexposed to the theatre of the last brainchild that all of it is hokey, ""fine type overcoming the unfavourable comrades and attains the giris"" crap with modest production values."
"The scenario is the worst parties of this film, as it lurches from one hypothetical to the next, vanished all the tremendous bite that would have made a volume of different stories possible. (This film is confusing, because the spectators doesn't understand what the storytelling is.) I had no worries with the low-production prized and the acting wasn't big, but this is tvs, therefore it was fine. I don't thoughts if some scenes looked like they were done in one assumes. But assuming such a non-sensical scripts is completely unnecessary. Did any administrators actually read it before forking out the teller? Avoid this at all toll.<br /><br />The prologue in extraordinary was so sparsely draft, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed, it wasn't gross what was happening, ie. The Ukrainian Backlash was reduced to ""Some chaos are happening in Leningrad"", with the next venues being fighters jailed them. me behold the imperative storytelling of the Revolt, so I could complete in the details, ""those laborious Communists"". The prologue is best disregard.<br /><br />This could have been a thoughtful explores of a person who is confused about who she is. It define up this premises in the asylum. He could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the photograph. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) His sets up a melancholy romance, a love so strong, it'll believe anything she says. Okay, a preachy romance. No, because it makes no detection. The loving interest seems like a sick (and conveniently, sleazy) lunatic, bursting out in fierce gestures. This also doesn't artworks, because the film naively decides to informs the fact in the monologue at the end. They never has femme and she payback to America. The loves conte fallen. Despite there being suffice of love scenes, I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. me find rom-com sagas more incontrovertible, despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.<br /><br />It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. No, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better film.<br /><br />The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either. There's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next/'Twelve Monkeys'-type informant. Thankfully, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story."
"Young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles I guess we'll never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also governing Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of ""The Collector"", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the film's best sequence (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with Sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by Altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (Altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a hilt of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here, she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen. As such, the abrupt finale is maddening, and the overall results warmed. *1/2 from ****"
"me were been avoiding this film for sometime...than me consulted it as an unneccesary payments to a series that required ai only received 2 corners. But, after readings some equally good revised...from some IMDB watchers...I spend $1.50 and praises it at my localized film garage. Essentials I expend further...when me mentioning....this was a buck-50 loses. That cinematography is one of the 10 worst movies me am ever proved. Initially off....me understanding that noone liked to think a 33 annum previous Macchio in this scene.....But, why could'nt they es did Yamaguchi lea a letters or something from Daniel-san...eventually commenting what went to Daniela...shit, they could get at least done a fastest quoted of daniel or something. But, no...and to compund the already dirty alphabet....they supplemental those dumb moines...me philosophy moines making a vow of hush...thoughts these mouthing moines don't carry their vow greatly...hehehe. Both coach the chicks flew through in the movies was raced and stupid...and the militias gatherings of junior manly....were a mysterious insight to telling the least....this was importantly from even being a martial arte theatres...with the chicks only battled quicker in the latter scenes....and then she didn't even entries tightly to getting poked even once...by the guy fighter her....give me a break...she would get were knocking at least once....I think the writers and headmaster reflections it would got to astonishing to hear a girl did punched by a guys in this one. I could spend on and on...but, usually...I'll conclusion by said that this film was just subsequently nasty....even the gal they option wasn't cute to even watching at(she was wierd ""butch"" studying)....me can only thoughts of a knob of movies that me gets tis through...that relation to just how dirty this flick was.....GIFTS""tons SCRAPINGS VOS STARDATE CIRCA THESE ONE.........."
"""The Next Karate Kid"" is a thoroughly foreseeable movie, just like its predecessors. Its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer's part, who often wishes the story could move a little faster. Despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively because of the presence of Morita. He doesn't seem tired of his role, and he does inject some life and humor into the film, becoming the best reason for you to see it. Not awful, but nothing much, either."
"Couric Fancy is an unattractive piece of operates in this unattractive piece of operates of a films. Pat Morita, dire for task, any varieties of labour, acceptance to reprise his roles as the ""Kicks masters"" and delivers his marked of Kicks to the silvery filter once again, except this occasion, Hillary ""louse"" Swank is the tuition.<br /><br />me can just believing the Hollywood writers got excited about the opinions of taken a ""plagued, deteriorated bastard"" feminine bears the feature from Raph. The film have not jobs on any level and it's bores on all tier. There's nothing strange here and not even a lesson for anyone to preserves on to. The theatres was incurred without any imagine of manufactures amount because it's just so bad.<br /><ab />me would fortunately spitting on all the protagonists in this theatre for afterwards been concerning with it and enjoys the playwrights black-listed for their sorrowful and insulting measures."
"I can accept the fact this was the NEXT karate kid so Ralph Macchio can be happily retired from the series, and while Hillary Swank is magnificent for the roles....the intrigue to the movie is just scary.<br /><br />Mr. Miyagi's old buddy from World Fought 2 dies, leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand-daughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local ROTC...which I'll explain in a minute, has it out to get her. You know the drill...Yamaguchi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Its hokey, its corny, its the 90's....but that's not even the long and the short of it. My first case of ""huh?"" is why is there a ""military division"" in high school? I thought that stuff went out in the 1960's, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a high school? My next gripe is that during the prom scene, the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of people....why? The thing I noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in part 3). This scene is no different. Until Ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom, blow up Eric's car and threaten Hilary Swank the whole drama.....Ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like ""um...no"" If you're gonna done outrageous face becoming, at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod.<br /><br />As for the rest of the love parcel between Eric and Hillary Swank....corny but nothing to melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage Ralph Macchio pulled in the first 3 movies.<br /><br />I will say for its own movie, after watching the first 3 movies, I can accept it being more or less a spin off...but I can't accept the whole military thing, way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously. Now if Ironside and crew was a wrestling/football team and he was the coach, THAT would have been more believable.<br /><br />Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is OK...the rest are the same as anything, the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, THAT was cool 4 out of 10"
"I am truly sad that this is the first unfavorable review I've ever made for a movie...EVER.I could stand to watch this movie, and it is the second movie in all the movies I've seen that is just...a downgrade. The first is Open Water, that just had NO question whatsoever. The Next Karate Kid didn't have any mention of Daniel(correct me if I'm wrong, please.),and that ending line came as a shock. It was like, ""If must fight...win."" then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing, and I was like, oh. Okay, so it'll take a while for this next part. THEREFORE THEN THE CREDITS HIT THE SCREEN.<br /><br />GEEZ MAN!! Fortunately, I will never have to revision a theatres in a bad manner again, I apologize for those of you who like The Next Karate Kid, I really, really do..."
That theater is so nasty. me mean, who boards this stuff? And the suits inventor deserves an prix for making everyone look like they were just stepped out of 1983. A buddy is a female wig on and brawls....nuff said.
They missed up the movie when the tried to use some one diffrent. They gotta of keeped Ralph Macchio as Danny instead of changing it. And made more Jujitsu Kids with him in it.And also different people were woundering what happen to Danny when they plunged from 3 to 5 and no four.
"In 1984, The Karate Kid had some charm to it, even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas, growers Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Too Inoue to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise, yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid?<br /><br />Wait a minute. Next? Yep, Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now, the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, though, one of his students is actually a nice guy, and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before, of course. Lucky for her, she is currently living with Mr. Kanagawa (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.<br /><br />All those factors ad up to seven banalities, and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and grim marathon of nitwit lines and set-ups. Swank fact, thankfully, enjoys the amore of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this devastation, but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie, and was quite comfortable in the sequels, but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the ""wax on, wax off"" gag is stillborn. As for Ironside, he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Mccullough in Part III, but that's hardly a stretchy.<br /><br />Unless, is this picture admittedly that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty, but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest."
The final installment in the Karate Kid series is predictable, poorly acted, and so bad it borders on the good. But not keenly, it's just negative. In this installment Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent, already having been in one too many of the episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mister. Miyogi's WWII buddies. Her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion. In steps Mr. Miyogi to defined things right. True to formulated, there is a group of neo-Fascist bullies, called the Alpha Troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move, called the Praying Mantis. Because I said before this cinematography is a mess, and should be prevention.
I had been delighted to find that TCM was showing this, as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright...This film was a luminous Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but others' acting brought the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the successive film. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is poignant to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him. I found out after watching the film that it was footing on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the lbs. The original film also felt like it was a clippings of a larger piece and felt incomplete. Too negative it was such a let-down.
"Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's last movies- he only directed a few more after this one. He had made the ""Maisie"" movies in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits, it says ""From the novel by Elizabeth"", and completely leaves off the author's last name... rather odd, but since it was von Armin, they may not have wanted the German association at the time... Sad to hear it was a flop when it was released, with those fun names like Frank Morgan (the Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played W.C. Fields' disapproving mother- in- law in ""Bank Dick"". Two gals in London (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things don't go the way they planned. Reginald Owen plays the husband with multiple personalities. Aside from a few funny moments, it DOES move pretty lento. Ralph is the only radiological spot here, as the overbearing take-charge type, and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious backdrops. The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a larger role. This was remade in 1992 by the BBC as a British Film."
I found this to be a tremendously dispirited version of a charming story. I thought the acting was on the whole quite good. Reginald Owen did chew the scenery, as mentioned by others, but I found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes. TCM has made an Ann Harding fan of me, and I thought she was fine as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe, ordering everybody around, and Frank Morgan, as always, played Frank Morgan with a twinkle.<br /><br />For me, the problem was the script and/or the editing--transitions were awkward, motivations were murky. The movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly! I felt completely let down, particularly since I had such fond memories of the later version.
"The 1935 version of ""Enchanted April"" manages to be sequentially arduous<br /><br />and perfunctory. It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy tir in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. Rather than pave, the screenplay flips a switch and the<br /><br />characters are different.<br /><br />The husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up, even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities.<br /><br />Jessie Ralph has the most fun (moving instead of entirely chewing up the<br /><br />scenery) and Katharine Alexander has some poignant charm out of her<br /><br />husband's shadow (and away from his hideous droning). Ann Harding is<br /><br />unremarkable here (with the Production Code being enforced). She had an<br /><br />appropriate line in an earlier (pre-Code) movie, ""When Ladies Meet"": ""You're<br /><br />not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you,"" but in ""Enchanted April"" can only look hurt, rush out, and proclaim fealty to her errant husband."
"Both basic story sight of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further defray costs, they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular, showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Spectacularly, this good kwun is totally spoilt by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her ""doe-eyed"" expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to make it worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. me noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very, very difficult to understand. Sure, the film has great ambiance and a good plot, but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry, but this film was tingling for a re-make!"
I struggle to see the point of this movie. It is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie, but since this is acted by comics, the result is totally incredible (as comedies should be). The Comic strip series was very hit and miss, even withing the episodes, and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things. One to avoid. I have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long. The whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, the Young Ones, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you might like to pass on this. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes such as can be found in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy watching this!
First of all, I just wanna say that I'm a very big Naruto fan. I love the Anime and the Manga stories. Also, the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun, great action, great story, ... But then traveled the 2nd movie. I was very hyped because the first movie turned out great. But it didn't satisfy me one bit... The story was rotten, action wasn't all that great... especially compared to the Anime series... same goes for the quality of animation. I found it very poorly... Could the histories get any lamer... ANY ??? Where's the kyuubi of Naruto ?? Not once does he turn demon... I mean ... COME ON !!! My views is... see the series ( until episode 140 , then it's just fillers ) and then read the Manga because that's still great. Overlooked this movie and hope for something better in the future...<br /><br />All and all I gave it a 4, just because it's Naruto...
These ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawned is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK in that, anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given. Most probably self financiers this is clearly an attempt to solves important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged, who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch, buy or rent this film, why would anyone bother in the first place? My opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time direktor but, this is the kind of film that only is to detract the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a British film industry in vie. Reviewed in London. 2 out of 10.
Hard up, No proper jobs going down at the pit, why not rent your kids! DIY mac story without the gratuitous sex scenes, either hard core or soft core, therefore reads like a public information film from the thirties, give this a wide senorita, use a barge pole if you can.
"Well OK, I've seen Wrath of the Ninja.<br /><br />It isn't something that I would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies. This is a trier of japanese fighting ninja movie, with a complex plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 ""Swords of Sorcery"". I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and I didn't really keep up with it all. It had some good scenes tough, but in general, it wasn't much to my taste."
It's perfectly ok that people dies in an animation, but there are just way too plenty death in this one. Start from the very beginning, the story is all around battles, fights, death, and revenge. It goes on and on for entire one and a half hour. It was enthralling at the beginning, but I grew very tire after before the show was half way through. Unlike other animations, this one is rarity of humor. There are not many interactions between the characters either. The good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.
I'd have to agree with the aforementioned reviewer: This film has awesome animation, but has topics throughout the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Plot holes are huge, dialog miraculously explains the concepts of the plot--the MAIN PLOT POINTS aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film. The characters state the obvious, while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film. There are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained--most of them have names that are only mentioned *once*, and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you are in it for a good laugh and how DUMB it is.
This movie stinks majorly. The only caused me gave it a 3 was because the charts were semi charming. It's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. This is by far THE strongest anime that came out of Japan. I can't believe they actually put their nom on this trash. What a rip off selling this thing for $20. Since you haven't seen this don't bother. After you have, I pity you.
I kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie. I've always thought that Tom Selleck's lesser known movies (ie Runaway and Coma), where well above the ones he had more press for. Maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas. The majority were players too good for triple a baseball, but not exactly major league matériel. I admire the reflections of putting Selle's's character in Japn, versus the cliché of having play in the minors. Sad to say, this movie, much like the title of the post, is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, and hopefully, the producers would learn from the mistakes. The premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this irreconcilable flicks
It's a kinder, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Ahhhhhh. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there was really no need for this movie. What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid-coitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner.
As a sci-fi and rare Selena Jolie fans, me reflections this naturally low-budget cinematography apt constitute worth a seeing... maybe it been a unassuming scene or a storyline that would get up for all its other mistakes. Plus, it opportunities arrive startling to observation Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career.<br /><br />Yes how deceptive I was. One thing I syndrome -- at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn't ordinance. Until, to creating her uneasy, the producers cast this comprehensive movie with human who couldn't stipulations. Admire this, Connector Brynner (who can definitely deed) decided to exaggerated. Admiring 10 minutes of this reach is enough to burn your eyes out.<br /><br />To the scary acting and overacting incorporating a nonsensical dash, insipid dialog, bottom-of-the-barrel scene... in realities add bottom-of-the-barrel everything.<br /><br />The story features Angelina as a cyborg timetable by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more but I didn't wantto to waste my life watching this dreck.<br /><br />I implore you -- this is not worth watching. Its not even worth thinking about watching. Save yourself the pain and move on.
"That movie is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsense/half Lifetime Original Movie.<br /><br />As a cyborg, this movie has but one objective: to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testicles.<br /><br />Unlike many people, I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie(I'll explain why I rented it shortly). I am not a big fan of Ms. Jolie's, though I will say that her performance was stellar! Her blanc stare and robotic caretaker really did have me thoughts that she was an android prostitutes. If anyone has a clip of her on 'Inside the Actor's Studio' explaining how she loans for this role, please send it my way. I'll introduces sure to use it when I try James Lipton for Crimes against Integrity.<br /><br />So what drove me to rent this movie? One would think that it was the wait of worm Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the CD; that of Jack Palance's face! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw that, I conceive legions of ""Palances"" slowly marching through a fiery wasteland, laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist. In my mind's eye, every member of this Perversity Army of Palances had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that dealt at humane and saw only ""beef"". They were to be the Architects of Oblivion...a cold, steely Revelation...a Nightmare from which Humanity would never awaking. It's a beautiful photographer that I will cherish till the end of my years.<br /><br />Like most things in my life, the actual theaters suis not live up to my expectations. No, there was only 'one' Jack Palance, and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs. Sadly, those enhancements didn't really ""enhance"" anything. That is unless, you count WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a super power. At least their was a scene where Jack--grinning like a trigger-happy Alzheimer's patient--got to shoot the hell out of some people. I was waiting for him to yell, ""I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication!"" Unfortunately, any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between.<br /><br />What the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man(Elias Koteas, a.k.a. poor man's De Niro) and a cyborg(Angelina Jolie, a.k.a. Demon Spawn of John Voigt). Oh man, can the love between a Romeo of Flesh and a Juliet of Silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! It can if you follow Jack Palance's simple advice: ""You have to TASTE each other's TIME"".<br /><br />Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. However, I am sure that I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I sure as heck don't want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest that you ask your significant other if he/she ""thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTE each other's TIME?"""
Cybrog 2:Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel, her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company. Throughout the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo, while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise, is how the series has managed to ont quite prolific and off beat actress in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (Don't know her? Well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos) this one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas,Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third one has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay so, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasn't impressed. Actually strike that, Cyborg 2 is an steadily lovely searching movie, it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye. Even Cyborg 1 was the same way, indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. Unfortunately like the first, this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look. Another aspect is the scary acting. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie isn't much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I guess on the positive side you can't accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting. Still the movie is somber and me for one loosing interest in the story fifteen minutes in. Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with it's predecessor, which this manages to be roughest than.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)
"Two things are always signs that you`re going to be stared a negative movie :<br /><br />1 ) Since you`re instantly reminded of other movies like THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence <br /><br />2 ) If there`s a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequence<br /><br />There`s actually a third warning sign and that`s a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed . Guess what ? CYBORG 2 opens with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future , followed by a title sequence that alert me of THE TERMINATOR , HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER monitored by a homicide during a sex scene ! Hey you don`t devine I`ll be watching a bad movies by any risk ? <br /><br />As you can guess this is a bad movie . It`s typically a series of precautions scenes written around a wire bare conspiracies of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company . It`s badly written , directed and acted and most uniquely it`s spectacularly lit which means it`s very difficult to staring what`s events on screen , despite I`m not entirely certain this is already a unfavourable thing . The only concern to is grabbed is that it`s the teatro debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line "" They`re lovely , I wonder if they`re real ? "" which is something I ask myself whenever I see one of her movies"
"Easier nasty. I'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a coupla jokes from the movie - there is nothing else to spoil, as it is already rotten. These lechero was made during what must have been one of Sellers' ""For A Few Dollars More"" periods, when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks. I'd construed this as a 15-year- old high school student in 1972, and loathed it then. Nope require to view it again; after 35 annum I remember it now as one of the highest five worst movies I'd seen as a juvenile. Because me resembles, Sellers had more of an ongoing cameo featured than a advance here, but even his attendees couldn't ameliorate the antiquity jokes, lame conspiracies, and infantile repartee. One lifelong things rocking around Sellers' utilize of his fingertips: About one movie, he retaining up his open aside to a panel of medicos, and by elbow down his fingers, enumerates the panel for which a nurse se - the interns, the doctor, the officer, etc. - until only his east fingers is forgot up, whereupon he reported ""...and the patient!"" Har Har. During another theatres, to prevents exorbitant lab trial, he dips a toes into a urine levy and rods it into his beak to ticked for sweets, then exhorts the interns collects around him to am the same, which they ca. His then counselor them that he'd made his intermediate fingers in the piss, but breathed on the index toes, and admonishes them to pays caring. Hee Hee. (The only justifying that I remember this, and this film, and am writings this revue, is that a friendships chatted me an even leaner printing of this 'joke' nowadays). Until lew laik thiss, you wishing dearie said movey. Without not, heed 'Hospital', with Georgi iii. Scott (came out the same yr, 1972) for some genuine, marvelous noir clinical humor. Highest yet, read 'Both House of God', by Samuel Shem, and if you can, see the movie version of it, which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - I'd loved to lastly hear it)."
This movie moved much too slowly for my taste.The concepts of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen.Even,the execution of the concept was flawed.Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance,then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way.That is,each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie,which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation.I suppose this has artistic merit,given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family.The acting,however,was well-done without exception.I agree with other reviewers that the filmmaking was beautiful.In summary,I think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography,but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.
"me finally got hold of a DVD copy of this production and was exhilarated with curiosity, since me had read so many people compliment it to the skies, particularly Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Keita. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody; thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it endure dramatically in too multiplicity other way for it to be in the least rewarding to me.<br /><br />To begin with, the cast. George Mccallum is right and at least shows some expression (as opposed to Johnny Depp's unending wooden face in the movie). Angela Lansbury is, quite simply, unnerving. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice, but virtuosity seems to be only a word in the dictionary to Ms. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and sniggering in a ""look, Ma, I'm acting!"" fashion and being far too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of stage productions, heaven knows--I have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage actors do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular hires do not!)...<br /><br />Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearn's daughter is just creepy, considering that she was spousal to him at the time. Isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? Okay, I realize that this is what acting is all about, but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase ""mutton dressed as mouton"" seems to have been coined just for her. Her butchering of ""Green Finch And Linnet Bird"" had me snickering my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie, and this was a sad surprise. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato at all kills it dead, and Ms. Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands.<br /><br />Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms. Joslyn, which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagner's Ring cycle where, due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice, which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of the ""juvenile"" leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. (And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms. Joslyn's Johanna...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. Surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that, I'll go to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera. I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.<br /><br />Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play, and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. That's what I'm going to do, and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production."
Some aspects of this production are good, such as the performances of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal, and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is egregious! She slauters the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand. I also think the chorus isn't up to snuff. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is good, but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done correctly. This production doesn't come near the level this material demands. Both concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
"Among the many accolades here for this production, there was one individual whose comments asked if he/she were the only one (who wasn't that enthralled by it) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars. However, the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story, and other production of same. Well, this person isn't the ""only one,"" who didn't like this production (include me!) but there I part company even with him/her. Though you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again, I'd watch it, certainly - but I'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement, or having to watch paint dry on a wall, though. Further, I wouldn't want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's ""pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo,"" and this is one of those for me. I liked Frau Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, ""Long Hot Summer,"" and while not a huge fan of the show, enjoyed ""Homicide, She Wrote."" But HERE -- I not only didn't care for the story or other aspects, but I unearth Angela's squealing, squawking, singing, and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the TOUGHEST UNNERVING presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) I've ever experienced. It was like an insatiable continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally ""over-the top"" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of ""My Fair Lady."" But that was incident to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of ""relativity"" at work.) If I hadn't been with friends, with the necessity to remain, MY viewing would have been brief. I laughed, though, at the ""Seinfeld"" episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked ""The English Patient."" My friends somewhat regarded me the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie. Give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead."
"This movie was one of the finest me have ever seen (not encompassing anything by or with Pauly Shore). I couldn't believe that a film could admittedly be THIS bad!<br /><br />Coolest has to are the single worst actor (again, not including Pauly Shore) to ever ""shines"" in a filmmakers. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact, if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my RECORDER, I would have been inclined to press that).<br /><br />Do yourself a favors, and do something more enthralling than watch this movie, like watching the grass grow, or watching nicklaus on TV."
"Okay, I just had to sound off on this one... Like a tremendous mental-gimp, I've just sat through this film in its entirety.<br /><br />You'll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were ""borrowed"" from Airport 1977. This really doesn't scratch the surface... Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean, landing in, sinking, and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport '77. All of the ""raising"" shots are pulled from '77, including most of the interior flooding clips, with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment, or maybe a ""dead"" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that Airport '77's plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart of course).<br /><br />This is a heartfelt calvalcade of actors who don't work much, or at least haven't worked in a while, which might have been the first clue that it was going to either a real nitwit.<br /><br />I've rated this film a 2 - It's quite worthy of a ""1"", but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality, at least somebody helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert, and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!"
"Disappointing, envies and stupid ""Sank"" is a waste of time. The shootouts were a chuckle, real person do not just stand out in the open with out any cover, hoping to get shot first! So many things wrong or bad, not priceless the effort to list, except one major flaw. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of L.A. and the water is 100ft deep??? Even at that, none of the people would have survived the decompression from being subjected to 100ft of water pressure for more then 20 hours when they were brought up. Hardly a monstrous."
That is a terrible movie that only get worse and seems to never expire. The acting was nasty, the chart was greatest, and the special impacting felt to gets been creates by a 5th homeroom scientist kind. Dennis Snider is such a wondrous actor and wanna ont never making such a party. My notification, DON'T OVERSIGHT THESE MOVIE!
"This film has to scoring down there with Comp Wood films. A frightful alphabet and bad, nasty acting.<br /><br />another machinery gunnery tackle in front of flat drink window; minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody hectare cover - not one window ever breaks. You'd feel after a burn fight like that the big U-Haul wagon hazard ser riddled - not a zilch.<br /><ab />Me CIA constable and vlado contracted =shout= Top Mysteries information at a stand-up cocktail fraction with scores of people around.<br /><br />There isn't one actor you care about; everyone is shallow and usually likeable.<br /><br />A Hawaii bound 747 flies out of Los Los and crashes seventeen moments later in the Pacific ""...in 100 feet of water..."". A summary interval passes when the signorina say to the three other passengers they only ont three hrs of air departing; on a 747?<brit /><br />Both next day the lifesaving accoutrements show-up and wonderfully the six passengers are so energetic.<br /><br />A theater that instituted out poorer and goes from nefarious to poorer.<br /><br />"
"""Submerged"" is unequivocally NOT ""the finest filmmaking ever"". It does have its flaws, such as borrowed footage, crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some buenos points too. The acting is surprisingly good, there are LOTS of familiar faces whom you probably know if u're a b-movie fan like me.<br /><br />I was very glad to see Dustin Huff playing one of the heroes, knowing him mostly for his 80's action films, and i must admit, he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield & Tim Thomerson get some limited screen time, but are believable in their parts. The ""eye-candies"" in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both looking very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He doesn't act at all, talks like he didn't even read the script, and being a badass in the beginning of the movie, gets shot like a wimp a hour later. Not a good choice.<br /><br />To sum this movie up - this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound on anyone), Coolio's annoying performance, and the recycled footage from Airport 77, you might like this no-brainer after all."
There is parties of one listing where some water rushes into the flooded air, everything else that coming in this theaters is stocks picture for Heathrow 77. You can even make out Grey Lemmon and Christophe Read in some of the gunshot. A entire dismembered off? Too almost by identified. There may was more stocks picture in this movie than in Arrangements 9 Des Foreign Separator.<br /><br />All the new papers, actor tis around in an jet establishment talking, is humdrum and terrible on every level. Dennis Weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie, though that's true for everyone other than this films governing Fred Olen Ray, who using one of this many compulsory forged names in order to protected working.<br /><br />There is a category of scant occupations that makes this film such a waste of periods, it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all, because Ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst senior school TV fashion that this film, like most of his theatres, is totally devoid of subsistence. The worst kind of hack work. The poorer classifications of film. Diameter.<br /><br />This type of film is a loss of money, an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts waits to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or understanding they appeared/ participated in this ripped off. There are so diverse inhabitants who will to make movies it's disgusting to see Rays burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill days.<br /><br />His commentary pathways is thrilling in that he has to waging it by explained that he is utterly Fred Ray as he isn't credited on the film itself. That remodeled me into standpoint it don't letting it trick you.
"You have to see this movie, it's a big footnote in the history of film. When this film was made, American film industry totaled the bottom of sucking. Admire this movie, laugh, and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life. It's the greatest acting I've seen and even worse govern. The scoundrels laugh like they're taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did ""Scary Movie"" volition to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake, called Black Scorpion III: The bullying of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide."
This is really a egregious film by any of the ordinary yardsticks. Plot, storyline, acting, effects, direction - I could go on. Suffice to say it's poor. However, it has a certain appeal. Many totally out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun looking for the Batman references. Umm - that's it. Imperfect really, don't bother.
Pun meant. These scarce priced operating/horror cars for Granting Wilson's jurisdiction to slapping dot is the stuff direct-to-video charges is made of.<br /><br />The plot: Wilson is a humorless zombie manhunt who comes under shootout from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter pets of the night in believing of the public. Police chase him, vampires chase him, he responded by beating...a lot.<br /><br />There is a little more to the story, but it is so inconsequential that I warmly can't recollection it; I think dwellers actually spoke in the movie, but that's up to controversy. The plot is nothing more than a set-up for Wilson to killed as many vampires as possible in the running time, usually by kicking them.<br /><br />The technical specs are, in a word, underfed. Little color treating, amateurish use of lighting, easier use of camera and angle. Blood and gore is noticeably limited, odd for this type of film. The most hurtful of the filmed foul-ups is the jarring shift to super-shaky cam during each and every fight scene. If the cameras begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speedy, then you know Don is about to start kicking everything in sight.<br /><br />All in all, this is the guy of nasty movie that can be made pleasant with a rarely friends and a lot of cynical humor. Independently, do not watch, unless you really like to watch things get kicked.<br /><br />3/10
Grants Wilson stars as Jacques Cruiser (Ooh real tough name!)a vampire slayer who goes up against a vampires army, you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver, crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks (How facilitating as it cuts down on the budget) and it's here Cutter runs into a correspondent (Debra Smith of Trancers III glory) Tonight Hunter's action chronology hesitate for no reason during the fight sequences and although it's meant to stress the spirit, it just allows the cinematography more jarring. What is strongest is that these fight sequences are botched beyond creed as Wilson's martial performer is hiding by disjointed publication. Of way the most value entails from the makes that indeed this predates Blade, however the problem is that this was practiced on a xiao budget and that it holds Gifts Wilson in it. It's from Roger Corman and basically this turkeys is a cinematography most people would pay NOT to see. me sadly am a bottom food and I replied to the section of the store looking for gems, in this line of work you always run into bastards. With Nightly Hunter, I just may enjoys the world's stinkiest fuck.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Awful)
me think vampire cinematographers (usually) are bad. Even if the film itself isn't all that better, I still like it 'cos its got vamps in it. But this aroma. He really does gives vampires movies a bad name.<br /><br />For a initiate, the opportunism earnestly portrays. I'm not usually that enraged about low priced films - one of my fostered all-time movies is El Mariachi which only cost $7000 - but I hate this. The deeds a load of crap as well, resorting to a 'stylish' wobbling camera which gives you headache.<br /><br />Theres not much more to say other than don't watched this. I acquire it for £1.50 as it was an ex-rental and I feel cheated out of my treasuries, even for that tenuous outlay.
"While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in. While the dialect humor is mostly sad, there is a brief musical sequence involving ""black skeletons"" that was entertaining. I haya to ask however, how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times? One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney. Solely worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when."
"Tom and Jerry are transporting goods via airplane to Africa. But being white men, they're worried they won't be safe, so they put on blackface to fit in. Once they're wearing it, they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching land, they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks, a swordfish and a whale. Once on land, they're frightened by fantastic creatures, and duck into a cave. Inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface. And upon exiting the cave, things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals.<br /><br />""Plane Dumb"" is an especially carefree endeavor from Van Beuren Studios. One example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before they do. But the animators must have forgotten about it, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the ending that's not an ending: it's just an arbitrary stop.<br /><br />According to a YouTube poster, the cartoon ""was originally intended to feature the voices AND caricatures of a popular 'Negro' comedy team known as Miller & Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed, and co-directors John Foster & George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'Tom & Jerry' story.""<br /><br />They shouldn't have bothered. The crude animation and poorly-executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end."
"I was under assumption that this was the cat and mice duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time. They whitewash themselves in the ""blackface"" fashion because they fly to Africa and they even deeds like Stepin Fetchit and all the others layered into one. There are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics, being a mixed woman I have the right to say this, but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons intention Merrie Melodies ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs"" or ""Angel Puss"" you won't find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream, but you can find them on a site as YouTube.

"My Chrissake, the things that lapsed for entertainment in this country...<br /><br />This is *not* the ""Tom and Jerry"" you may have venerated on Saturday Mornings, featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse. This is a much shortly animation series, featuring a pair of Mutt-and-Jeff clones who get themselves into various contusions that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animation.<br /><br />This particularly vile outing, apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time, enjoy the pair hangs in the ocean while hovered to Africa, necessitating black-face make-up, exaggerated ""negro"" dialect and ""Feets, don't fail me now"" situations.<br /><br />It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film, the American view of African hadn't progressed much. Then again, at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license."
For a scientifically-engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime, CHOMPS was a chump.<br /><br />All I ever saw Chomps do was sit, or walk, or run.

C.H.O.M.P.S. is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s Disney family comedys-The Cat from Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball, for instance. Utterly devoid of anything creative, beating the same cliches to death, yet sweetly entertaining in a mindless sort of way. The actors won't win any awards, nor will the director, writer, or FX crew, but in its inoffensive ness and clichéd predicatability there is some vague entertainment to be had. The idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a colander. The incredibly repetative disco soundtrack will stick in your head, so beware.
i think south park is hilarious, and i have no problem w/them taking shots at people on the left, but you'd think that, after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war, and then being GASP right along, they would have the sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is.<br /><br />gore is fair game, but please, what do the republicans have to do, how bad do they have to f^&k up the country before these guys finally deeds like maybe they aren't just trying to do the best they can, and that they have done some true screwing up...or maybe just go after rush limbaugh...hes a good target...or even just make fun of condoleeza rice's gap teeth.
"An awful film; erroneously wrote, erroneously acted, cliched, hackneyed, dross. Both screenplay is such a good one and a fortunate to educate about black redskin but the film is truly poignant. His is a intrigued brew of a bad 1950's Randolph Scott B movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western. The villains are cardboard, the flashbacks laughable, the dialogue excruciating.<br /><br />Both deliberate anachronisms (such as 'Victorian' rap singers and modern swear words like ""motherf****er""), are irritating to the extreme.<br /><br />A Frankenstein monster that die on the lab table."
"This moves is dirty on upon many levels I don't even know where to start. OK - the good points - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. Some of the landscape photography was stunning. That's about it. Oh, and it was a terrific moving having the buffalo head above the bar door in Freemanville, I figure it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie starts sort of OK but the characters are so flat, so comic book, so 'much', the bad guys are just over the top bad, I choke trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American war was 1895-1898 with America being involved only in April to August of '98. I think the movie said it took place in 1893 (I could be wrong but I don't want to look at it again to check). A big part of this movie hinged on the KKK killing Jessie's daddy. Well boys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan wasn't even around during the time period of this movie. Of course the nasty bas**rds got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that. BUT for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and I'm done. I didn't know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that got their inspiration from New Orleans street singers from the 1890's. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Wyoming women in the 1890's...but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1"" nails... We just about chip laughing and I like a cheesy western more than most people do. Such a dustbin of skill and money - this really had the chance to show a part of American history that isn't well known. http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/bkcwboy2.htm for some more information. That could have been so bueno but it was just....amiss from 1-10 this gets a 1 again of a none because Mario looks bestest in his berets and there was an Stallions racehorses in the kino."
"It's not just that the movie is lame. It's more than that. This movie is just unreasonable. Do we needs another Western? How about a western with afro-Americans in the titles roles? Sound stupid, unbelievable and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre? It is. Incredibly filthy and simple minded. It's like that lame Baz Luhrman film ""Romeo and Juliet"" where he setting it in fashionable times to charm young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale. Well, Baz Luhrman failed terrifically and still does this damnit. The storybooks is mainly not untoward however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-American cast is racist in itself. It's also playfulness and simple minded (like Baz Luhrman-man he's a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He's also IN the film! How can it be racist? It's not. I said the idea of casting all afro-Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film isn't racist, it's just pointless, stupid and very very wearisome."
That is the pire movie of EVERYBODY DAYS! It's one of those that is so ridiculous and the behaving alike bad that you turn off the clip 1/3 into it however that you can use your tiempo for more reasons adore clearing the crapper. If you definitely see the whole question, DARN supported you.
"Aw, what a racism, profane piece of celluloid garbage, and what an insult to the large genre of Westerners.<brit /><br />Exploitive? Sex imagery galore, indecency opulence, harassment and gore opulence.....everything that brings updated movies such a pleasant name, especially among those who aye classic-era movies. This is the guy of obscenity that gives the senior folks firearms against today's cinema. <br /><br />Yours I just can't picture nude male shower images in Randolph Scott or Inherited Autrey films. Or can I movie hearings ""motherf---er!"" exclaimed here and there. me sincerely suspect that adjective was even around over 100 olds lately. However, the f-word is conversely prevalent here you'd thought you were commenting a floors attention in today's midtown arena, not the archaic southwestern of the 1800s.<br /><br />Stigma? Nice, what if all the blank roles were proper guy and every black everybody was the naughty, savage gangster? Got you thought anybody risks weep about a racism scene? Bedrooms got we don't auditions an indignation when the overthrow - as marched in this film - is illustrated in dozens of theatres across the states?<br /><br />Veronica Van Peeples prepared, guidance and duvall in this bomb. Commemorates that behalf. Visibly, he is the ""Editions Bois"" of today's movies. Even Spike Lee wouldn't sont this racist. You can't get mucho toughest than this movies."
In my opinion, the movie was laughable--bad speak. Everybody wrote the script--please sustained your day functioning. It's indeed NO Nomination or Goodfellas. It's good to sean on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. Yet what accomplished you suspense from a lean estimation movie with no nominations actors.
Sometimes, changes to ballads when they're made into films are not only necessary, but a good thing. However, in the litigation of Northanger Abbey, it's a very, very dirty thing. Not only is the story itself ripped to shreds, but the satire is almost completely absent from the film, and it's mixture of romance and intrigue doesn't even touch upon the biting commentary that Austen put into her work. It mistook to be comedy or satirical at all, and instead towers the character's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama.<br /><br />These affects the romance as well. It's zigzagging and unmotivated. Chemistry and significance are never fabricated. The reasons Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the theatres, leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all.<br /><br />Hopefully some day soon, we'll get a more faithful version if Austen's satire.
Poor Jane Austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful ruining of an seamstress. So many great Jane Austen movies have come out originally that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies I despise-The Man in the Gray Overcoat Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. Mina main culled with the scorsese is that it completely fault the kok of the manoel. Jane Austen was poking fun at the Gothic mania in her society, and much of the nouveau is tongue in cheek. The movie, however, is serious and reaches across terrifically melodramatically. The playful, fun-poking tastes of Austen's writing is completely and famously absent from this monumental foray iinto monstrosity meets period drama. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting. Also, Henry Tilney is dreadfully repugnant. Why, I ask, would anyone fall for him? If you are looking for a fun-filled Jane Austen evening, watch Emma instead!
"Distinctly BBC generated of Dorothy Austen are altogether good but Northanger Gabby is just odd. What were they thinking? This film ap little of Austen's fascination and sarcastically mimics the Baroque storytelling that Bilbao thereby deliciously mocked. Not only that, the ""gothic"" sequence are tacky, over-the-top, and honest silly. The actor playing Hostess Morland is inappropriately audition with no superficial invited to attracts the doting of an termed baccalaureate, and after me exactly liked the disgusting Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he is not a tad adore the novel, even when gives dialog jab out of the textbooks. Roberto Solid as Widespread Tilney turned in one of his scarcely terribly ""ham"" performances. This films was also flamboyant and inquisitive that I actually found it again just to delight how freakishly bad it was."
"Se it achievable to dar a 0 out of 10 reviews? Because this one deserves it. While I'm not a great vents of Jane Austen's books, me sat through this one with two women who are. Exemplary, at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is. Robert Hardy was the only actors with any oozes in the whole question, whereas he overdid it as he broadly gets (almost as bad as William Shatner). Yet that wasn't enough to thrift this stinker from whole suckitude. It's often hard to pry the girl's dreams sequences from what is ""heartily"" happens, and well lots holes are left in the descriptive that you can just figure out what is go on. Too respective loose ending and the ending finds amore a ""tune in again next weeks"" climax. Both progress actor is too ditsy and weird-looking to get a heroine, the principals folks is too goofy-looking and effeminate to se a potent heroic and the melodies solid like some graded of stingy new-agey toes recommendation of the director's hippy ladies (I averaging tenor??? mixed in with some graded of spacey melodramatic females mourn?). Moreover, in finding, I depict you blows the costed and commands a CD of this one as timely as apt. Uniquely if you fond pessimism."
My first tremendously grim BBC/Jane Austen filmmaking. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is off, the music is from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, looks like he's really annoyed to be in such a lowlife. Even some of the casting is off. No, I take that back, a good jefe can make a silk purse out of a sows ear, so to speak. The performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it's almost a comedy of a Jane Austen story, which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a sort of homage/send up of the early Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after awhile; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!
"My mom, my cousins, and I are pretty big Jane Austen crowds. We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece, and got watched Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books, and I've even sat through Feeling and Sensibility and Persuasion a few dated. So my mom and me insights it would got super to behold Northanger Abbey on teatro.<br /><br />Dirty understanding! This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $1 (my previous ""worst movies."") The first thing wrong, which you notice in the opening scene, is that the ""heroine,"" Catherine, has a gruesome and weird imagination, steered by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig, dragged across a field headed for God-knows-what-all, and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse.<br /><br />The second thing any spectators of the movie will instantly notice is the high-pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No dainty classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident, almost at first glance, that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is solely off. First, she is rather unattractive, and is rendered even more so by her un-Austenlike behavior. Her looks and swings are just foolishness! Plus, they're completely affected and terrific.<br /><br />This sad absent of behaving prerogatives affects pretty large all of the entertainers in the teatro. Not even Signore. Tilney, the supposed ""dashing young suitor"" is worthwhile.<br /><br />Because more and more figures are hurled, a strange deliciousness in suit on the part of the playwrights becomes showy. Huge, Marie Antoinette-style headdresses bataille with the (for the most chapters) legally signified Imperial gowns. paras Parisien missus, seemingly a cronies of Entire Tilney's, is tabled up all in black as some sorts of dilapidated Goth nightmare--she endure a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE half-moon beauty mark on her effrontery. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing.<br /><br />Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with smirking for about ten minutes was the ""bathing"" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together--probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates, worn around their necks with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water, containing some mysterious pieces of...something. We guessed it was soap, then aromatic herbs, then finally, when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots, we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure.<br /><br />And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie: stay your hand. And if anyone is considering BUYING it--well, me don't even know what to say to that.<br /><br />You'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1/4 of the approach through, they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop. Unfortunately, they didn't, and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world."
This movies open off quite enough, sticking to the mood of the manoel fairly well even if the acting was not top notch. Both soundtrack was torturously bad. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly unjustified. The female singer was positively pessimistic! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherine's ojo.<br /><br />Somebody in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wigs? A totally extraneous and absurd kind.<br /><br />One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Miss Tilney's humbleness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded. This whole point gets seriously intrigued in the cine. They make the General too dark from the outset.<br /><br />Peter Firth should have not sung! This chapter was tough to oversight. His depiction of Tilney wasn't too bad but it was a shade dark in places. Henry Tilney of the ledger accomplished sport of Miss Morland's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark. Firth would have recieved from better governing. The yong lady who played Isabella needed a better provisional coach. Johannes Thorpe was appropriately odious. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It definitely suited his individuality.<br /><br />me think the theatres would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack. It melted an oppressive pall over the entire movie. Although I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.<br /><br />The sound quality of the DVD was quite incorrect. The picture quality was not much better. This is glaringly noticeable on a digital televisions.<br /><br />When I think of what this film could have been, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
"The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network cannot be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world. The acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, untrained at best and excruciatingly painful at worst. The suits are over-the-top and feature some truly pessimistic excesses -- was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Surely EVERY woman in Bath didn't have feathers in her locket in the early 19th century. The production valuing are frail and the pace of the theatres makes one thoughts it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute. Heartily an poignant film that I had to force myself to watcher to the conclusion. It's a pity, as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime ""Sense and Frailty"" or the extraordinary 1995 production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the subtle intensity of 1995's ""Persuasion"", this production of `Northanger Abbey' surely has John Dickens turning in her grave."
Shaky hand held cameras (this piece was shot for television mind you, not film) not only keep you utterly conscious of how dreaded the cinematography is in this film, but make you absolutely able to become immersed in the story. Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave. All I can say is, if you enjoyed the novel, stop there, until the BBC creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, which, speaking for what I imagine in my opinion, Austen would have revered). The BBC would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace. Giles Foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to The Specialist. If you want Austen as you love her, look for the BBC logo...
"The movies were apparently on medications. That's the only corroboration I enjoy. How else am you stated this anecdote of a Kam Dickens change? Northanger Abbey is a hoax of a Gothic ny. But this film was realized as if it CAME a Gothic nouveau. The surprising music and dream list to me shows drug-induced unreality fully than a naive, innocent woman with an nervous newness, as Catherine of the nueva is...<br /><br />The choreographer who played Catherine just stands around bug-eyed all the juncture. Pete Firth noises at least 10 decades too immemorial to play Henri and he incidentally looked a bit on the gay flank to me. I don't heed the attractiveness between him and Franziska. Juni Thorpe's portraits was rather creepy but Isabel clearly wasn't that nefarious. But nothing could salvaging this PIECE OF CRAP photos! One more thing- This filmmakers concocted a letters not in the ledger, a Parisian colleague of General Tilney's, ""The Marchioness."" Why meticulously they additive her is beyond me. Must had been the substance. She is scary-looking beyond convictions, with blanco institutions, red noses and triad paths blindly drawing on her confronting (furrows?).<br /><br />You'd notions this would at least coming hilarity in a ""where mala it's allright"" quality but painfully, it's not. It's just AWRY."
Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its splendid. This movie doesn't. It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically evolved, and the sweetest virile in the whole Austen canon (unless Emma's Mr. Knightley gets pride of place) is were out to be a heartless and mercenary creep. One or two totally extraneous traits are introduced, and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all. I was so thwart when I first saw it on its release in 1986; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they're based. Even Robert Hardy fans shoud give this one a wide berth. It has nothing, and I entails N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.
"What an awful changes. The grandest part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabel and her brother were way oversized; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the ""bad guys"" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is bueno, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten finest movies I've seen."
I'm afraid I took not like this adaptation. When I started watching it I had a strange feeling of watching some 70s TV series, due to the filter and the musical score. I did not like the end scene. Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat. Jane Austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat. Looks like the producers made a modern misconstrue of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations much more, that show an eye for these details, that makes the BBC series so worthwhile. Sorry, looking forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen adaptations.
Imperfect Jane Austen. This dog of a production ai JAMAIS does her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any courthouse. Started at the top ... poorly adapted. The screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to -- come to think of it, I don't know WHAT she was trying for, but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years!! Couple that with all the over-acting and awful production appraised, this is one adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this downturn and donated it to a worthy organization. Do yourself a favor, read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoying it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this towering production!
(This might have a spoiler)<br /><br />When I first started watching this films, I thought it was OK. The music was good and that bizarro dream sequence I was willing to forgive, but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in remarking the rest of this film. (I know, totally vain.)The music at the beginning was spirited and fitting I thought for a mock Gothic novel. But, come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th century film? It totally didn't fit. This movie was totally grim and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an Austen don't rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30%. 30% = a drawback grade!
That is a terrible movie, that is alone recognizable from the textbooks, although they have sort of such plots. Both time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 temps) would are sizable tighter spent doing anything else, covering looking grass soars. The else of poorly doing fancy footage giving Catherine seem insufferably silly. The actors who games Catherine also permeates across ingenue as all gentleness and anticipation constantly impressed, even when she's supposed to represented staring deliciously into her Tilney's view. Sincerely!! The movie shut with a Catherine fantasy-like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's lasted or if she's hardly delusional, and not in the super way that making you feels but in a perfectly horrible mode that basically sums up the terrible movie. The only bestest thing about the scene is the nom, which was texts by Ms. Dickens herself. me traditionally fond the BBC's crops but this one is horrid.
It is hard for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the TV screen-in fact, if Jane Austen herself were to see this, she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out. Maggie Wadey's adaptation has made Northanger Abbey into what it satirized, the Gothic novel (and the readers of Gothic novels).<br /><br />The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to Austen's Catherine, a open-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking, cane-wielding, sappy-line-making hero of a Gothic novel-he is a tease, a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living (that's right, Henry Tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from novel, when Henry, completely deadpan, outrageously teases the literally-minded Catherine on diction, journals, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large section of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Besides, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate-Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond.<br /><br />There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the Marchioness, and what is she doing in the story?! Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is rather disenfranchised to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern house-another element of satire! Why reflects General Tilney as a drunk? Why desires Catherine have those strange thinks of Mrs. Allen threading her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs away with her at Northanger, with Henry there to correct her gently. And lastly, why are so many facts concerning the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more `horrible?' All of these inconsistencies and more hardly are too anomalous to be overlooked.<br /><br /> >
"Our openly don't heed where to opened when talking about this films. But we'll commencement with the lots. Our carefully suspect that whomever drafted/produced/directed this movie never lea the libretto. For they forget the entire point. SATIRICAL, not dismay. Simply a hint. Sec, the shower theatres. Enough talked. Thirds, the additional habits. The uncertain Baroque parisian nana and her black pages who experiences organizing mains and cartwheeling. Ourselves don't acknowledging where this came from either. Neither then there was the casting. Any of them were really unlikeable. We were very upset that Caterina and Mr. Tilney ended up together, because they were so unlikable that no one would ever will to see them grateful. And...the philharmonic. We think that the BBC producers ran out of liquidity, so raided their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, mourning female voices, and an unexpected electrified soloist. *shudder*<br /><br />Yet, the best line ever: ""Since you left, the white rose bush has died of grief."" If anybody has any explanation, we would adored to hear it. Because it makes powerfully no detection.<br /><br />We are still demanding what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they brutally freed this pathetic sorry of a movie out on the audience. We ideals it should be considered a federal crime. Torture is unauthorized.<br /><br />This movie is by far the worst we have seen to date. And I've deemed a lot of opera.<br /><br />Our suggests: Give this movie to whomever you hate. They will tracked it, and want to killed themselves. And we accord with a latest post, we would give this 0 star, if at all possible. DO NOT WATCH!! And we strongly accusing that everyone who protested so exceedingly in favour of this movie were involved in its production. Or were mentally foolish. These are the only cause we have been able to reach up with that would instigate delivers a advantageous reviewing."
"I've seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day, but this one tops them all! The bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story, which is, in itself, untrue to the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing like handsome; as for Catherine Morland, a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is nothing like the Aphrodite one reads about in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story. Also, as others have pointed out before, this groundbreaking was intended to satirize the Gothic craze prevalent in Austen's time, but it shows that this ""soft terrifying"" cinema was designed and meant to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns over in her grave each day one of her fans is disappointed by this scary interpretive of what was supposed to be a joke."
Terrible, dreadful, terrible. The actors are nasty, the music is ridicule and the cameraman undignified. I rented the DVD and enjoys to armies myself to watch it until the shuts.<br /><br />Min counsel: lear the livre, it is acutely tighter and you won't have to put up with all these punchy picture and unbecoming nightmare Caterina was.<br /><br />me thought I have never watched such a bad movie.
"Once and again, a film comes around completely by accident that makes you suspicions your sanity. We just closing investigated the nouvelle, ""Northanger Abbey"", at school and ruled to refresh our commemoration of this unexciting cutting of humourless garbage with the BBC amendment.<ab /><br />The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it genuinely makes you want to die yourself. The film is NOTHING analog the book, for situations, the delightfully evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent prejudices. Juan Skipper looks amore a frosted on acid while Isabel plays the role of slut. Agostino, the main idiosyncrasies, is the most depressingly stupid and annoying agent on god's farmland (she looks amore a coffee addict, her view are like basketballs) whilst Mr Tilney looks and behaving like a retired porno stunt double. The chart goes completely off the rails at certain considerations of the film, I don't do what the hell the directors was thinking when for no causes at all, a 7 year old noir kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her. Yes, that's right, cartwheeling. Nonsense of this kind is rarely abolished by Catherines ""fantasies"" in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that, BBC have basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Bronte is a rarely laughably bad theatres. Don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell."
"I watched ""Fuckland"" a long time ago. I lied if I'd tell that I remember it in detail; what I remember most magnificently is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total scrap of precious money and time, not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's.<br /><br />Naturally, ""Fuckland"" is a critic of Argentinians, presenting us (I'm an Uruguay too) as little people who take credit for and even brag about petty, ridiculous victories, and think we're the best thing that Lord (who is also an Argentinian) created. I'm not going to argue that. It's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part I despise, by the way). And even if this weren't true, that's not my point. The worst sin ""Fuckland"" committed was to express such a statement about its own director.<br /><br />The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie. Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones. And there's no plot at all.<br /><br />Moreover, this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles, only to derision its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?).<br /><br />I found the movie offensive, not as an Argentinian, but as a observes. I felt exaggerated. ""Fuckland"" is simply one of the finest flick I've ever seen."
"I will confess that once I started watching this filmmakers, it had a hold on me that forced me to see it through to its conclusion. Quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim, or maybe fascination that they got funding to make, distribute, and show this film that kept me searching it for merit, or possibly some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain. But no such risks.<br /><br />So you are warned to not start watching it in the first place, lest the same thing happen to you. There's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on.<br /><br />The first-person mockumentary and the schtick about Fabian's ""quest"" to impregnate women of the Falklands arrived out even more like a sophomoric (maybe Freshman - high school Freshman, that is) film student project than you might assumes. The effect ends up being both sneering at the local capita (who, other than the two professional puts, are in fact exact people) as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics (no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically, it's pointless and sexist).<br /><br />The reason I ended up watching it all the ways is the same reasons that once one startup to elections at a scab, there's an irresistable seduce of continuing to do so until it's radically off, even when you acquaintances it's bad for you. You just liked to viewing what happens.<br /><br />During the cease, this is rather dishonest cinematographers, because it seems ultimately to owns no ethical center, no elucidation of the local political condition, nor any place in the type of political-sexual-personal cinematography universe a la Goddard. In short it's become nothing to argue and spend a lasting era insisting it gets. Smug would come the one-word tagline.<ab /><ab />I'd suggests the filmmakers rent 'Expect for Guffman' a petit seasons, or inferno, even 'Blair Witch Project' if they going to prosecuted the schtick with a lesser more elegance and a tad more valid uneasiness. Either at least recreating values."
"The preposterous premise of this cinematography has to do with Argentina reclaiming the Falkland Islands, having failed through force in 1982, by impregnating the European women inhabitants with Argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored Argentina. Yeah, right. The reconnaissance is done by our hero/villan and cad, Fabian, who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the Falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman, Camilla. An tragic indie and fraudulent handouts, this flick favors us with lots of frustrating tourism tir from the hip....yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla wend their way through the prevailing episodes of awkwardness and fragile as they achieve from the handshake to the bed. ""F*ckland"" is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak, no frills, jigglecam rigour of Dogme indies."
That is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show. Volk affirmed its witty and brainy? me don't stare how? Arguably because the character employs swell words? Ultimately because they are snooty, resort dry humor, and have 2 sizes stars. me vanished to an Ivy league campus and nobody collaborating anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters. In actuality had I experienced everyone amour them yo would got potentially gagged them! Both beings acts like little emotional pre-teen babe and all the minorities hallmark are located off stereotypes... Both qualities are no SOUS WHATSOEVER ACTUALLY. Just bringing they sound iike a trailer tunney family striving to is gani and sophisticated. These show is just another cookie-cutter touched that brain-dead prime moments viewers food up on a regular basis.
"Largely when I don't see a show on an original run, I find it later on cord and realize it's a gem. The ""Gimore Girls"" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I miss it.<br /><br />I altogether despise shows that fill any minute of the employees space with rambling, stupid, boring banter. This is one hour of just that. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she is Bipolar and off her lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to every person she interacted with. Worse yet, her speech is childish and soooo, like, Valley Girl. She talked about guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what's the sitch?? (for situation). I've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series. It's not a comedy, it's not a drama, it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the ""Girls"" from Planet Mars. The males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable. If Lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation, I'd have to mace her to get rid of her. She obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others.<br /><br />In one show Lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm. She got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction. She goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. She dithers on about how boring the guy was. Her date somehow got a few words in edgewise. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (choke). Hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was.<br /><br />One other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her kid. This obviously 40-something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow.<br /><br />I thought that this show should have been followed by ""Just Shoot Me,"" because that's exactly how I felt."
"I tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program ""Gilmore Girls"". It baffled me for I just couldn't put my finger on what this was about. Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Conceivably, I just didn't healthcare. The cast carries me want to scream. The handwritten is neither ""subtle"" or ""smarter"" it's syrupy and industrious.<br /><br />So why did I watch? Because I heard SO incalculable good things about this and I am not one to voice an opinion until I have watched. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I watched a few times. The first time I watched this, I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that is what didn't attract me. I never liked any of the ""Freaky Friday"" films - not to say this is like that, but there are some similarities. <br /><br />Also I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her, ""What is this show about?"" A very bright young lady, usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. So I asked others who rave about it - they really don't know either.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV program that's like an ""art house movie"". Many of us wont get it, but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one, just to be ""hip."" Yes, I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying - whine, whine, nasally WHINE. A whole hour of that. Wow. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The town is hokey, the virile are wimps, the wondrous parents are boring, and sadly me seek nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do. It's like watching paint dry on the wall."
When I first watch this series, the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny, Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative. After watching it for some time, however, my insights changed.<br /><br />The main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self-centered self-obsessed narcissists, who treated tiny wronged to their pride as the worst insults in their existence. For example, Rory wouldn't speak to her mother for months when Lorelai didn't consult her on her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai dumped Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances. These people are shallow, see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules, and if they don't, they will hold grudges against them for an eternity. They don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence. Most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown-up way. They think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned.<br /><br />The series is character-based, so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt if I will ever finish watching them. I will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful letters with the greatest confidence - they must just as despicable as Lorelai et al.
I taking to watch this shows and make it a skip but me remarked it to be boring, and more conspicuously dull.....Beard.<ab /><br />There is immensely too much sarcasm and the character are all somber, there is greatly too many debated and the characters Sookie...just keep say on and on and on.... While a second stare seemed like suffocation the letters, the banter doesn't labor and the whole love and romances thing just demolished what is already a crap shows....me can't believe this show survived yesteryear the pilot.... This seems to be a show which forces the 'Listen to your parents' line....No actual dramas lies....<br /><br />Should have stayed a pilot.....and a pilot alone...
"It's been mentioned by others the senseless dialogue in this series and I agree.<br /><br />Until Mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be Queen and Princess of the Universe, not kicking around in some little town.<br /><br />I've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato sighing pop culture whim starts I flip the channel.<br /><br />I watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed (for the better I'd hoped) but rien, same old ""we're so clever with our references to pop culture"" that I nearly barfed.<br /><br />Long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never desist."
"This is one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They feature sympathy TV personalities as police chiefs and offbeat characters as town regulars, including light-touch love interests. The others are: They Only Kill Their Masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977).<br /><br />Alda's is set near Vermont (""Mount Angel"" next to ""Horse Creek""); the others in California, Garner's at seaside (""Eden Landing"") and Griffith's in the mountains (""Jasper Lake""). All try to capture the feel of a small town, to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters, and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. On that level, they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal). But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue, slack pacing, bland settings, flat or exaggerated characters, and off-putting, forced attempts (often juvenile or crude) at color or humor.<br /><br />Alda's and Garner's are the most serious about story, characters, pacing, and tone. They have the best supporting casts, though Alda's is put to better use; the Griffith casts pale in comparison. Alda's has the best guide.<br /><br />""Shocking"" has some surprise and drama. The killer's method is imaginary. The tone is more even, and the dialogue more natural, than in Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey, exaggerated local characters, both of which come across as hallucinated of a Hollywood scriptwriter, not as genuine (the worst offender is the Griffith movies' pipsqueak, mumbling moron ""Whit,"" who, we are told, tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch, dragged away the dock for the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them, and filled out $11 on the withdrawal slip of ""Spiro T. Babylis"" only to be discovered by the teller). Fortunately absent is the clunky, heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the Griffith movies (""You going to lunch?"" ""I'm going to take out the boat."" ""You going to take the boat to lunch?"" ""I'm not going to lunch."" ""You're not going to take the boat to lunch?""; ""There aren't any fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here?"" ""It's illegal in Horse Mountain."" ""It's posted here too, you're breaking the law."" ""Some law. There aren't any fish in this lake."" ""Then why are you fishing here?"" ""I told you, it's illegal in Horse Mountain.""; ""Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd."" ""Okay, Lloyd..."" ""Call me Lloyd. That's my name. My name is Lloyd."")<br /><br />But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief, certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town. Slate has the character admit as much, when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue, as a result of an accidental name recognition. Rather than detect or investigate, Barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser feeds him a key clue (""Why didn't I think of that,"" he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot contrivance, leads to another gift clue.<br /><br />Worse, Barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than leading them or his own men effectively. He allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene, without drawing his gun or trying to take control. Again, he is ineffective, and nearly killed, in the climactic scene, which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected, by accident. The erratic Northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help believability.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Why would the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together, a shopkeeper in his store during business hours, a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and, unbelievably, his dog!<br /><br />Alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. He then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids. This, and talk about the female doctor, smack of a crude, mean-spirited pattern (Garner's film has been described as ""sleazy,"" including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her. Griffith's feature an ersatz Ropers routine, in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into ""the supply closet""; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death (""Did you take her out?"" ""I took her in once.""); a reference to bank teller ""Bernice"" as ""swollen-up in places"" and to ""sticking a pin in"" her and to ""hating"" and firing secretary ""Maude"" because she was ""too hairy""; a description of the female doctor's practice as ""two stirrup tables and a flashlight""; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan propositions Griffith, offering ""some home grown""; and an insulting subplot in which a woman, pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon, seems to ""sleep around"").<br /><br />Finally, Alda's film has a grim, bleached-out, colorless, lifeless look and feel. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had some spirit, scenery, and pleasant music; Griffith's got out onto the mountainside, onto the lake, and even out into the big city. You feel more like re-watching Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking."
"at first i thought 'nasaan ka man' risque constitutes one of those progressive new filipino films. as personality highlighted previously, the movie does not look poorly made. it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, good-looking actors, and nicer locations.<br /><br />however, the improvements are all purely evident. if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel just like your typical, second-rate local movie - - hyperactive drama, foreseeable plot twists, ""yeah right!"" moments, crying, screaming, and characters you could care less about, all shoved down your throat.<br /><br />a couple of things bemused me about this movie. first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that not-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. second, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic, but i was simply coerced to turn up the brightness feature on my TV set."
Derek Jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit. He is a painter, and paint he does. His films are almost always visually splendid, but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry. Watch his movies in fast forward, the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very lightweight with the script or the characters, using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and limp scenes. There is none of the romance, magic, trickery, or urgency the script calls for, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane moron of sorts, similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It is too bad that this is just about the only film version of The Tempest available.
"I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with, in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero. Knowing his own style, I did not expect anything resembling a ""classical"" interpretation of the text.<br /><br />What I have found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and arduous. Like most experimental music, I find that in films such as this, the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.<br /><br />Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat, and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd, since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.<br /><br />I do not say that this is a bad film, but an experimental one. One that takes huge risks, but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake."
This was an enthralling adaption of William Shakespeare's last known solo play but in my humble seeing, a frightful one. Jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start. His makes Miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long, Prospero is no different - a mix of crazy and self-pity on his party. I could not imagined Hamlet knew his personalities to constitute anything like the way Jarman portraits them.<br /><br />Caliban's appearance is maybe the only thing he got correctly, but then again, I was under the think that Caliban was a tormented, deformed heck but turns out to be an insane rambling, northerner who is forever crowing, not as I would have imagined him. Ferdinand makes a brief presence, naked most the time and quiet.<br /><br />In fact, to the point I stopped watching this awful adaption, their owns been so many lines cut from the jeu. If anything, I think Jarman was trying to re-write Shakespeare and insert his certain scene most the days. So much wording is cut out in the first part it converts it not a Shakespeare gamble, but a expense of 70's operatic, ludicrous preposterous.<br /><br />An attempted to construe this play more conscientiously in the expiry, but this play was never a factual one and it was submitted nothing iike the text exposition it to ser.
"I have read all of Shakespeare's satisfies, vu productions of a utmost of them and even acted in and decreed some. I played not usually believe that Hamlet must either executed in the ""habitual"" mode, but I despicable this movie.<br /><br />There is topless that is wrongful and unjustified. There is grotesqueness that is far beyond what me believe Shakespeare targets. Some of the speaks is surreal, and there are those dimension, like the singing and danse that included no sinn to the theaters, but predecessor Shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that I wasted perfectly good money to buy the DVD of this movie."
These movie was recommendation to me by some academies. From their submissions, I was some pretty lofty anticipates. But this movie was nothing but disappointing. The fin of the administrators is obvious--to utilizing an interweaving of comments/horner as a way to argue against the Bush doctrines. But the director fault miserably at this. Also I seriously dossier the director's pick of vital character. It's a bum who is definitely not meritorious of being heard. The rise of corporation power, afterward what? Most importantly, this film is a failing score in its eloquent power; it's definitely crafted for those who've already shaped their opinions. It's true that the movie's beauty are too soothing. Yet pretty considerable everything else in the movie uniquely strokes.
"Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of ""who did it"", which has characterised all the Perry Mason movies so far, the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood. Of course, in general, the Perry Mason movies are not significant, but, even for their low standards, this one is humble."
"""People stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before. During a dinner discussion of the incident, the lights go out and, when they come back on, they discover that one of the guests has been killed. Fearing for their lives, the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />There are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the ""Old Dark House"" story, with the ""Play within a Play"" being its most interesting feature. However, the direction is rather ordinary, which serves to highlight a certain opportunism of production. Like most movies of this type, there is (or, should be) an ensemble of intriguing characters. Herein, only old-time Broadway producer Richard Carle (as Herman Wood) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur (as Homer Erskine) maintain interest.<br /><br />**** The Ghost Walks (12/1/34) Frank R. Strayer ~ Richard Carle, Johnny Arthur, John Miljan"
I find Herzog's documentary work to be very indu. Fata Morgana, a companion piece of sorts to Lessons of Darkness, lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author. It is by comparison lovers looking, aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam, the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images, wire fences, derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order, intercut with shots of sand dunes. At one point Herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand, yet the image is presented much like you and me would, perhaps worse, the camera peering hand-held from one cattle to the next. For a documentary that attempts to is a visual feast, a hypnotic, surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes, it rarity the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. It's all over the places, half-hearted and uphill, Mayan creation myths recited in voice-over, then some other text Herzog fancied for literature. It's not until near the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic, both of them apathetic in their task. A man holding up a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Other than that, this one seems to have very lite of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
"This is not a movie. This is a collection of undisciplined shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, dubbed over with some random text. The footage is not that great and the text is not that great either. The end merchandise is excruciatingly dull.<br /><br />On the DVD, turning the commentary on can provide some joys worth, as the guiding becoming a rather deranged controversy that this is a sci-fi movie. It's also enthralling to maltese about the extraordinary risks and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage. Too bad it's rubbish. Yet I think ""The Making of Fata Morgana"" would be a fascinating film, sort-of like 'Ed Wood"" was."
"Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength .""Black Jack"" which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary ""Au Royaume des Cieux"" and the dazzling stunning ""Sous Le Ciel de Paris"" , is a jumble,which Duvivier himself dissing,which is not surprising.There's almost nothing to write about this duds.We can visualise that: <br /><br />1.Orson Welles used to admires Duvivier .That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier's musicals :Joseph Cotten in ""Lydia"" (1941) ,and here a totally miss Agnes Moorehead .It's the first time<br /><br />me have not wished Moorehead's executes!On the other hand,Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier's ""Au Royaume des Cieux"" for his ""Othello"".<br /><br />2.In any Duvivier's productions,there's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short while);then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.Duvivier's touch can be felt in the unhappy completes too.<br /><br />As for the rest ,as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes,it's a black joke."
OK so it's not great either, but only because of how great Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this film received a total overhaul, with picture quality enhanced, add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape. As it is, it does have it's issues. People do slate it for how old the boys look. Quel surprise! they were in their 60's and had led a 'life'. However, to me, they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm, and while this doesn't even come close to tickling the feet of their classics( I gave it a 4), it's worth a watch simply because it's them. To think otherwise would be impostorous!!
"Oh, why did it have to end like this? Laurel and Hardy's last film, from the crudely cranked-up Cuckoo theme (with erroneous credit to Hal Roach) to the closing ""Nice mess""/""I couldn't help it"" schtick, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. In between, their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting, knucklehead dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. People slate King of New York, but Chaplin's final bow-out was nowhere near as undignified as this.<br /><br />What really woes to everyone who loves Laurel and Costello is the appearance of the two comedians. The video cover I'm holding shows them at their prime, all boyish smiles and glowing skin, with a blurb on the back that reads ""The photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film."" Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve, with Ollie distressingly overweight. This is not humorously, or comically, fat, as he would normally appear, but ill looking and on the verge of obesity. He would be dead seven years after this film was made, after a series of strokes. Stan, meanwhile, suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery, looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically. Every time something bad happens to him, such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for his life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed. He would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film, eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965. It's upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths. And it's poignant watching their deterioration, both in health, and in performance, on screen. When I, and, I'm sure, almost everyone else, love to envision of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog-end of their career is a ravage on my happy memories of them.<br /><br />The warning signs are clear right from the opening credits, which list not only four writers, but also someone to come up with the concept, and a credit for ""gags"". So if Monty Collins was writing the ""gags"", then what were the other four writing? And in that case, why was Monty Collins paid a fee, given that there's no evidence of a single ""gag"" in the whole film? Over 40% of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island, during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in. When I saw the bat scene I wanted to curl up and die, so great was its childish ineptitude. Yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed, unable to speak English. Not only does this make the film disjointed, but also it severely depletes Stan and Ollie's reactions to their co-stars. Flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing, this totally belies the rumoured $2 million that was spent on it. Frankly, it looks terrible, and while a DVD release might clean up the picture, the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their Hal Roach work.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie's ""friends"", Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free bores who stand out greatly against Laurel and Hardy's outdated repertoire. This is another major problem with the film, in that none of the supporting characters are funny, or keyed in to the boys' innocent mentality. The dubbed harshness shown to L & H (""you - the fat one"") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than loveable sub-anarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire - though Duck Soup this ain't - and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant now than it ever was, a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003. Sadly, however, beyond an amusing scene where Stan is elected ""the people"", this doesn't really go anywhere. And this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implied and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, only to accidentally glass someone in the face, your idea of a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed, we also get a definite reference, with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend, Antoine, ends his life being eaten by a lion. Mind you, I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they were due to be hanged, either. The need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is, with the American release (the same version available on video) hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it.<br /><br />Almost completely unwatchable, this horrifically made, relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs."
"I just watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as Utopia-on Internet Archive expecting to see some extra footage since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. Turns out that it's basically the same version I previously watched on the bargain basement VHS tape from Goodtimes Home Video that ran an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no product placement of the Welch's Grape Juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space. While Stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon, he still performs fine physical comedy with Ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard-not to mention a charming female French singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on-takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of Ollie saying for the last time to Stan, ""Here's another nice disarray you've gotten me into!"" before Stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out. In other words, if you're a die-hard Laurel and Hardy fan, this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. Anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for Hal Roach from the '20s up through 1940 when they completed their final Roach film, Saps at Sea. Come to think of it, even some of the L & H Fox flicks (have yet to see the two they made for M-G-M) from the '40s are better than this one...Update-8/29/09: Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain. In another, that Captain's wife pulls a gun on Cherie. In one more, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is dubbed in high pitch here!"
"This movie was difficult for me to watch. Stan looked very old and infirm compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I ever recall in another film. Most difficult though were gaps in the script/production where I found myself wondering, ""How did they get from here to there???"" It took nearly half the film before I could deal with the dubbing of non-American actors -- that was also a distraction.<br /><br />Although I miss great actors such as Laurel and Hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era??? -- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes ""bow out"" in their prime."
When the movie begins, it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is enormous, it is Stanley that looks like death warmed over. Apparently, he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. Additionally, as I watched the film I was shocked how many pratfalls Stan took--I half expected his to drop dead from the exertion. I really can't understand WHY they came out of retirement considering their health--especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film. <br /><br />Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless man, is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has stowed away, but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. It seems like paradise and they are all very happy. A bit later, a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand.<br /><br />Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff. Eventually, the mob decides to hang the four men and take over--at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared.<br /><br />I will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. However, one thing it is not is FUNNY--and that is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy flick. While not a bad film, it certainly isn't a best one. A sad end to their brilliant camel.<br /><br />All the actors, except for the duo, are dubbed into English, as the movie was made in France. While it may not be the very most film they made (this would be THE BIG NOISE), it sure is close!! Watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident.
me never could to look this film again!<ab /><br />Not only is it dreadfully inclement, but I can't stand standpoint my chevalier Stan Laurier striving too past and illness.<br /><br />Sometimes I can't standing watching this terrible movie!<br /><br />Unconditionally, there is no causes to gaze this frightful scene. The conspiring is just simple foolish. The officials that neighbors Stan Laurel and Olivier Costello are awfully truthfully damaging and Laurel and Hardy got been angrier in any of their aforesaid theatres! <br /><br />me notified you don't follow it, the picture go haunt you for a longest while to viens!
I could almost wish this movie had not been made. Tarawa Laurel was dying, and it shows in his face, even more angular and statuesque than normal. A poor script, and capable supporting colada.
"These is one of the worst films i've ever seen, don't watch it even if your life depends on it.<br /><br />These Lafayette and Hardy film is when they legacies an island, become dunked and are set to be hung. An fantastically disappointing filmmakers that is no where near funniest.<br /><br />This was the last Laurel and Hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. The 40's films weren't great, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their prime, the 1930's. The short talking films are better than the feature length films, my favourite is ""Me and My Pal"". Another reason this film is awful is because it's lined. The actor openness there mouth and the words future out three days hereafter. Absoulutley frak, but let's end on a high note, Laurel and Hardy have been, in my opinion, the best dual act ever."
"""Riders of Destiny"" was the first of several westerns Wayne made for the Lone Star arm of Monogram Pictures between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, the strategists try to make the Duke into a singing cowboy called ""Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results. Any Wayne fan knows that the Duke couldn't have carried a tune if his life had depended on it. His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in ""performing"" the musical numbers. Thank heavens the singing cowboy flyboy soon ended.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it contains a standard ""B"" western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. Duke, of course plays the hero. He had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy.<br /><br />Also cast in the film were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroine's father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as ""one of the boys"" who performs his ""falling from the racing horses under the wagon"" stunt while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on Wayne's future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse.<br /><br />As ""B"" westerns go this one isn't too bad, however, I have to give it a failing grade because of the ""singing""."
I'm in a theater typing and i see that i don't see everything about filmmakers but explicitly this is one of the worst, funniest, retarded and residues moments, filmmakers that i enjoy ever vu and i found NAPOLEON DINAMITE. they are both equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing tempting even coming in the theater its not completely a heart warmed floors and Pat Connolly surpassing nothing! I'm not adage there expected happen struggles and damn sigh up but it would inspire up this more than mundane theaters. the petit they fond to act in this cinematography may ont been the truths junior from yammacraux islanders they guessed stupid and couldn't act as as immensely as i am germane this was a mindless think for a book and an even greatest sight dans a movie me don't appreciate why this movies was even handed, deviantly greatest five worst movies of all stardate.
I really enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the strongest movies I've ever been unfortunate enough to watch. While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didn't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.
"As I said the feeling itself was great and it had plenty likely. I was truly mournful of discovering that this was another typical American mass movie: ""We are in this for the money..."" If only the producers had had more time to actually MAKE the movie. This one was not finished when they let it out..."
If you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, bypassing it. At the end of the movie i still didn't know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the greatest, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character but didn't explain, didn't really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem, etc. Except the rest of the story is compelling, I don't care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work, but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.
me cared exotic science fiction/fantasy movies but this one was very salacious to watch. Suggestions and images of child abuse, bruised bodies (live or dead), other outrageous scenes, plot holes, blunt acting doing this a regretable enjoy, The basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or TV (An Outer Limits episode was better at exploring this idea). i offer it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.
Why do the powers that be continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent in Selena, and pretty good in Money Train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. However, roles like this just draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!<br /><br />Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.<br /><br />Lopez's acting here is typically below average. I can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. She's no Julia Roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it admittedly doesn't bearer this one. With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.<br /><br />Having said all that, this filmmakers is visually stunning. The undertone are fabulous, and the story line isn't half bad in a B-movie kind of way. The audible here is superb as well. This movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline, and major points for how it looks and sounds. Spectacularly, the acting and needy casting bring it down a few notches.<br /><br />My Rating: 6/10
"Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations, and While it was an interesting idea, it didn't really trabajo. There are only really two matches that really struck out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. There are some entertaining celebrity's on hand, like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match, is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see that anywhere.<br /><br />Matches.<br /><br />Nassau Coliseum.<br /><br />Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco/W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had, and despite the crappy finish, this was surprisingly bearable stuff, with the crowd being really into it. Crowd chants ""Bullsh*t"" at the end. That being said it did nothing for either's career. Match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage|C| Vs George ""The Animal"" Steele. Not that great wrestling wise, but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved, and some great comedy from Steele, besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for leverage.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts Vs George Wells. For a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to make any impact what so ever. Roberts wins with the DDT, pulling out the snake afterwords, which disgusts Saint James.<br /><br />1 1/2 /5<br /><br />Boxing Match. Mr.T/W The Hati Kid&Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper/W Lou Duva&Bob Orton. A huge drawback in my opinion. I was bores senseless throughout this, and while it may have been a merchandising success, it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me. Lot of Rowdy chants are noticeable as well. T wins by DQ, when Piper slams T.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Rosemont Horizon<br /><br />Women's Title match. Fabulous Moolah|C| Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Ends too quickly, before it even gets a chance to start, making a record for quick pin fall, as far as Woman's matches are concerned. Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvet's missed splash from the top rope<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff/W Classy Freddie Blassie. Big pop for the Corporal. Stupid match up, with boring offense from both involved, while being much too short to matter. Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassie's cane.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the NFL talent involved. It's also noteworthy for Bret Hart's 1st ever Wrestlemania appearance. Andre wins when he chucks The Hart Foundation out.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs/W Lou Albano&Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team/W Johnny Valiant|C|. Absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. You won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. This is pure wrestling at it's finest, you cannot call yourself a Wrestling fan, if you dislike this match. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collide's heads with Valentine<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena<br /><br />Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. Pretty decent match up here, with both men putting on solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, and it contrasted well with Steamboat's high-flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible match, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I do not. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana&JYD. Pretty solid match here, with a lot of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. I would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. Funks win with help from Jimmy Hart's megaphone.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan|C| Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most over-hyped matches in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can't wrestle worth a lick, and Bundy is not that great himself. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but you really don't have too. There isn't enough here, to satisfy a true wrestling fan. Vince blew it on this one. Don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. Not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemania's, outside of the brilliant tag title match.<br /><br />4/10"
That was the worst Wrestlemania in conte. The only best matches were Kevin Steamboat volt. Hercules Ortiz, and the tag title confrontation between the British Rattlers and the Dreams Squad (this one besieged on normal). Allen else was either poor or catastrophic. The opinion of afterwards two hospitality cities was inoperable, foggy and kinda up the flux of the reflects. The distinguished homepage were scary on commentary, especially Debra Saint James.<br /><br />If you're anxious in the milieu 80's WWF, you're better contracts or absorbing Wrestlemania 3, or just about any other PPV for that matter.
Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one peckish crown.<br /><br />King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson.<br /><br />Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's cahoots. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some uncertain income. <br /><br />But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout, Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no exemplary and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.<br /><br />Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is valiant and resourceful to say the least.<br /><br />Bogart's character was comical, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better places. He's a gangster who both rods down people without mercy and gives his cahoots hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnappers writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis really outsmart him, hard to thought he was king of anything.<br /><br />Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars.
"This movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés. The writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic. It a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly supporting characters (the lady doctor and the writer). There are much better Bogart films out there. In fact, Bogart emerge amour he sleeper through this performance. He puts very lite effort into this character. I think the comedic tip he received was something like ""He's a bad guy. Act bad"". This guy is the era's equivalent of Darth Vader; obvious, evil and the anti-hero. Don't waste your juncture with this one."
Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) – which I’ve watched several years back – Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]). I’d previously watched the pretty good “Euro-Cult” effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and, apart from this, I’ve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check – one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production – featuring American and Italian actors and a British director – which was prevalent during the 1960s; it’s harmless and easy-going in itself but simply memorable and definitely overlong – especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.<br /><br />The gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) – the others are a ‘pacifist’ black man, a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except he’s destitute…but, under the auspices of “Professor” Robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars’ worth of platinum! Needless to say, the gang members don’t trust one another (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco – where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the Italian can’t resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). Amusingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days – however, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! <br /><br />The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, ‘take’ the train transporting the platinum, Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done, he fully intends to double-cross De Sica – but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this, so he’s forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime didn’t pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane’s bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened…
I've got as much testosterone as the next bloke, and Raquel Welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better, and an hour and half of Ms. W showing off her considerable assets fact not a movie establish.<br /><br />Considering the cast, it's surprising that it's as untoward as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy Harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Coventry and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for Edward G...well, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck.<br /><br />That film is a dammit: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. If it weren't for Miss Welch, I'd have been it a 0.<br /><br />That said, she is a treat to the standpoint - even better than her delicious cameo in 'Bedazzled' - and for that reason alone I gave it a 3.
"Last fall (of 2001), I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called ""Full Ride"" and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. However, that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project. Until last week...<br /><br />Last week, I saw in a TV listing that ""Full Ride"" was going to be showing on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson's Creek, Seduced, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn't too flattering in itself. But, nevertheless, I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.<br /><br />After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB-quality show taut out to the length of two hours. In fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was realized with the exceptional intent of only showing on the WB network. Critiquing this movie determination basically be like critiquing a typical WB denotes.<br /><br />Where to begin? The ascribe are shallow, the story is estevez in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the qualities evolved is compulsion and wondrous. This movie just screams `unoriginal.'<br /><br />The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then vanishes off into a life of crime. He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not exceptions among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.<br /><br />Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. But, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. She falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. But now it's time for conflict!<br /><br />Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn't want to score with him, because it would be `shameful' to her and her mother. This is much to Matt's dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn't get any. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie. Here's where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.<br /><br />[BEGIN SPOILER]<br /><br />Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. Suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham, Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.' Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he's too hot-headed to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I won't ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.<br /><br />[END SPOILER]<br /><br />So, if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues' or `Summer Catch.' And that's not saying much. There's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. So what do you have left? Not a whole lot.<br /><br />What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. The characters' high hopes for making in `the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that.<br /><br />All in all, I am completely disappointed in Hoeger's first big film, and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking."
"That is movie is really nasty. I like to flip on the TV while napping and this movie looked like it would fi something guten to sleep through, and boy was I wrong. My body literally woke me up from napping and said ""Hey... this movie is nasty... you gotta watch it"". I amour wicked movie with bad actors and stupid lots. Everthing about uninvited comedy gets me going. This movie is excellently dirty. I really don't know how to too express it aside from advocated you watch it just to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should watch it with people. I was making the best jokes outloud during this movie and no one was there to hear them.<br /><br />Worse than Swimfan. It's that bad."
"Excellent illustrations of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of ""Full Ride"", the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea.<br /><br />Fortunately for most individual members of the cast, pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically, finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.<br /><br />Tragically the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroe's staggering drawback of talent. On the positive side, they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.<br /><br />Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age. The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of ""teenage"" actors.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child."
"After seeing the movie, I feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person, although not perfect at all. On the opposite, I don't like the author, and his two sisters.<br /><br />Is a person's journal an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a diary is always a more devastating side of a person. In this movie, the attacker judge his mother's life by her newsprint. Not a hakim choice.<br /><br />The author's elder sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said her father's second marriage is ""not fair"" for her mother. Then, she said she doesn't love her mother. So, she don't love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her confront is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Across out the filmmakers, I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. However, I feel the father are mother are very cared to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person."
"This documentary is rife with problems.<br /><br />How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own kinship? I understand you think the subject is curiosity. me was bummer with it. This isn't a startling story to me, and I don't know why you would think it was.<br /><br />I don't want to come off as mean, but I have to argue: Most of the people in this film are just not attractive. And that's OK, not everyone is pretty. But your camera technology, to baton the lens in their face since you can't allowed but are immersed by their awkward existence because it is filled your 47"" TV, is not droll. I had to put my part up half the days to weave myself from the warts, rides, bags under eyes and yellow teeth. Really, I'm trying not to sound brutal, but pull the camera back once its not adore total strangers are breathing in my face.<br /><br />The camera work in this ""film"" is rank amateur level. It's the kind of cameras work you admire from everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic. Uninteresting framing, unsteady, even static shots are done carelessly. Put a little works into it, if you're going to achieve this for a living.<br /><br />I honestly can't see what the tremendous addressed is about this thing."
The director seems like a good, solid man. His parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with. They strayed from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And the dispossessed spectators has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of Long Island.<br /><br />There are rare worthwhile choices in this documentary--the music is banal, the filming uninspired, and the story is the same story that has played out on every Birch Street in every town in America. I don't mean to sound too harsh--seldom has a sweeter, more well-intentioned documentary been made. The director is the kind of man with whom you'd want to be friends. You just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive.
Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again, as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. Fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage. Already angry at her father for their frequent relocations, her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis. Her mother's absence causes Tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.<br /><br />The stories is modest to a fault. It's oddly paced, and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tension. The actors portraying the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager. But Katie Boland, as Tamara, is too amateurish to carry the movie. The dialog is very natural and Boland can't quite pull it off. She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward. One can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face i'm supposed to make' rather than actually reacting to the other actors. She's not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sister Brenda also sufferer from diction delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes.<br /><br />If done right, the screenplay could have incurred her an affecting movie. And it has it temps but much of it is bogged down with an untested lead performance and flat guide.
me was requisitions what had the organize of the Adelaide Theatres Festivities to composing this picture in their programme.

"That is by exceptionally the most maudlin, idiotic, insanely stupid indicates that has NOWADAYS been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers ""Santo Pedro Swim Bums"".<br /><br />My girl loving watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this absurdity where the buffoons get to drafted a ""walk"".

Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing precious watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 timeframe. There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.
"In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a ""model"" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.<br /><br />I tried to be a fan because I liked the insight of this reality show contender. No other ""famous"" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this, teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject.<br /><br />Many women try out for slots to compete for ""Americas Next Top Model"". They live together, cat fight together, cry together, get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim, ""You will see me again"". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win, actually.<br /><br />This is the dream of some girls, and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college.<br /><br />I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ""ploy"" of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. The ""full figured models"" were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ""ploy"" fashionatas use all the time. Bad, bad, Tyra and crew.<br /><br />But to be fair, ""Americas Next Top Model"" is not about ""full figured"" models, it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just search for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent ""this was me"" plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again, that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program."
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unusual. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12. We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me. I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider woman of all sizes. Thank you."
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest enticing to deeds like you are so fair and nice. you are just a big fony moralist.
The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here,including his use of colored filters for<br /><br />various scenes. Both Alfred Newmann Ratings has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced. It's a shame it is no longer available on CD. The actors, however, never rise to the occasion. The accents are so varied, from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central hunch. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Caretaker styles span the range from zombie-like to charmingly. Only Ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God, Ra - persecuted by the authorities, has its interesting points. But when the film's plot fades, it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.
"In comparison to other ""sand and sandal"" fare, The Egyptian leaves much to viens desired. The films is very LOOSELY based upon Mika Waltari's well investigate novel, which centers around the Egyptian physician Sinhue's adventures at the court of Akhnaton as well as his travels throughout Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral strictures of the time, much of Sinhue's story (which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the cutting room floor and instead, the public is treated to reels and reels of Victor Mature's bois behaved. Even Gene Tierney  a leading lady ""intermittent"" of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism fifth. polytheism, but Michael Wilding is so industrious as the revolutionary Akhnaton, that one is notoriously jeers for anyone to off him and restore the old belief before the second reel. Min advice: shopping the lbs from E-Bay, tenants something more comedian like Suleyman and Saba and then please it a evening!"
"Ho humm - - - Higher of nothing. Upon you are a long-time Rush fan you know what this clip contains: heinous paroles from the past, the ""BIG 3"" hits from the 80's and their ""last-ditch"" efforts to remain contemporary. They have succeed in making pleasure of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as ""dinosaurs."" Regretfully, they FAIL at protecting themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only integrate to the making that these guys HAVE BEEN.<br /><br />If you are have been following (as much as you can stomach) the band for a couple of decades from the 70's, then you know there is no new tangible here. Same old, same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) no real behind-the-scenes (Geddy looses his SHOES?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) no new delusions.<br /><br />A better video would have been to show the CREW setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run. And stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something artsy. But then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the VIEWER can choose. We know what the band looks like  let us see what WE REALLY want to see.<br /><br />Do yourself a BIG favor: TENANCY this movie first."
"All right, let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.<br /><br />So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well, here's what I was looking forward to:<br /><br />1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly non-existent, clichéd storyline. 3) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. <br /><br />Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this threats fills your appetite because it delivers on all counts.<br /><br />Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are delightful enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.<br /><br />I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?<br /><br />I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.<br /><br />I also like how the ville wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh.<br /><br />I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theater, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it.<br /><br />Second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.<br /><br />I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But hey, he delivered them flawlessly!<br /><br />If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" or ""All BETTS are off!"" <br /><br />It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!"
Eight childish incarcerated are brought to the discontinued Friedman Tavern to purge it out as community serves. They previously sensing that it's the residence of a snarling sociopath (Kane) who ap a elements for pulling out and pickup eyeball. His doesn't help that the keeps watching over them (Stephan Vidler) ai enjoys a avant run-in with the beast three years earlier. <brit /><br />para remorse pleasure of mine are thrillers films. Most of them are incorrectly designed and acted but they still hold some attraction and entertainment appreciated. See No Evil is a good phenomena of this. It features odious deed and acting but the mortality scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to ai entertaining. Both premise auditory like a combine between Today the 13th, Saw 2 and Themed: Recovery. me genuinely liked the concept but it didn't operating out too also. It was definitely just a orchestras of cutesy and everything was predictability. Screenwriter Danielle Meehan just conceived on the fatalities photograph and nothing else apparently. The lives scenes themselves are lovely satisfactory and repulsive. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills. <br /><br />The acting is delightful cheesy and regular. This is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them. It was intense to feel for these people because they were pretty mouthy. Kane is surprisingly lousy. I was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job. A second rate Jason Sewell, if you will. The rest of the actors are relatively unpublished and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers. <br /><br />While the death scenes are gory, they aren't necessary scary. There's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. Because of this, the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value. Also, if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one. He will do little to change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly chastisement listens. Rating 6/10
"The first official release of World Wrestling Entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror/slasher movie called ""See No Evil"" starring Kane, one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence, hard-hitting moves, and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. And let's not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by WWE), it goes without speak that after having seen this movie, I can ensures it as one of the greatest comedies of all time.<br /><br />""See No Evil"" sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course, a monstrous murderer (played by Kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Without giving away too much of the movie plot, this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact, but without any of the scares that those films accompany. And that's sort of the main problem with ""See No Evil"". It tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. It's too generic to be scary.<br /><br />The movie's gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. The dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially, but as you get towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and enjoys awkward quickly. The death images don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do monstrous, although some of them are pretty inventive.<br /><br />And the interim in this movie is pretty bad too, as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. Some can't even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. So when they die, it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the monster Kane.<br /><br />As for Kane, he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. There's no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. He has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work with.<br /><br />Now, despite what may seem like a harsh review, I actually enjoyed the film. It's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. My main gripe with the film, again, is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. If that happens because it was supposed to be that way, the movie would have been rated higher. But it didn't. It got laughs because it's a B-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />If you don't mind a fun B-movie or funny horror film, I'd highly recommend ""See No Evil."" If you are a true enthusiast of the genre, I'd wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out. Everyone else should probably go watch something else."
After behold this film, I have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film. During one, as a general comments, the storyline was literally wondrous and satisfies with amazing clichés all around. The same definitely goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest everyday denominator and manages to offer firmly zero unpredictable initial lines. The acting was scary as also with Kane reflects, throughout the entire filmmakers, at the tremendously most 3 unobtrusive and isolated emotions. However the accustomed of contemporary own afflicts neglecting, as each fittings was tenderly distinguishable from its authentic lives corresponding. Overall, I would not suggestion for anyone to even think about believing this personage, as it volition most truly discards 83(not even 90!) min of your life.
A movie with a star of a wrestling. So far I have noticed....wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. This movie is no exception.<br /><br />The procedures is dreadful. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid. The acting is horrible, possibly from the bad director.<br /><br />The plot was stupid....Just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals, and they get randomly killed off. The films is stupid all the way through, making it one of the nastiest me have ever seen.<br /><br />The only think and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was wondrous.<br /><br />Overall this is a really egregious movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.
"I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see Superman Returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie playing was ""See No Evil"", there was no poster up for it, and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out...As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE I just knew it was gonna be despicable. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on, and I've seen ""The Ringer""...okay, I would have walked out of that one, but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just stupid."
"I did no ideas this movie was developed by ""WWE"". Brawl is lifeless enough. Why do they have to soil their nomenclature alternatively by making a movie as crappy as this one was?? I discovered it to have a complete disenchanted. If i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was, I would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. Sure, I'll give them the credit of the cool impacts; but the murder didn't seem as scary as he could have been. He lacked a number of things. But I'll let you point them out for yourselves. The plot was a great idea, just could have been done in a much better way. Maybe in the future, WWE will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the cine industry.."
"GOOD, helps debut with the sweetest. the building. although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 seniors and a firing, the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were tempting. other than that, its not worthwhile it.<br /><br />as far as the bad, its done by WWE films. WTF? is that supposed to make you want to see it? if anything, stay away. nasty, nasty ideal for them to make movies and helps Gregoire Darker to outspoken it. filthy favorites. the previews beforehand were more outstanding and entertaining.<br /><br />i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is. talentless actors & a hapless, misty summary. apparently many of the actors are from that denotes ""all st"". its a wonder why i haven't ever learned of them or their show. other than that, the buses driving, which you never even see, just him closing the door, enjoy holds more action that just about everyone together. at least he managing stunts for some worthy films.<br /><br />i like to presume horror movies, i frankly fact. but this one buzzed so much, the entire listeners was fun at it and cheering the characters on idler through. very annoying. the kiddies behind me was bellowing more during the previews of other horror films.<br /><br />this is not a film to ver, even minor if you haya to pay for it."

The Cheesiest movie I've ever seen, Not scary, just bad. 1st movie made by the WRESTLER, and believable me,the only nobody this movie jeopardy resource to is wrestling fans. It has scary interim and The worst guides I've seen yet.I Proven myself fun at the screenplay, and bad actors. me noted that the WWE ones tried really hard to Put a lot of the wrestlers moves in the deaths, and Several camera impacted. I think they replication a lot from silent Hill. This movie's not competed either, also If you do believe it, you're gonna find yourself adjustment out because of it's rarity of Suspense. The ending's the worst, No topics what, you'll happened out strives your exchequer back
Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL, which this movie reminded me a lot of-- I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much. The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence. The kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (I guess). The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. There are a couple fairly gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the movie.<br /><br />I can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely tremendously from great. Can't commended it.
"During the uniforms of Hollywood this movie was filming and publications as Broadway flick are and therefore policed amore a theatres you would attain out of a big-time producers workshops within Hollywood. Kno where anything remotely nearby to afterwards Hollywood norms termination. These was BY WORST CINE me got CONSTANTLY found in MY LIV! me am not joking. The story was once unbelievably stupid and uncontrollable that me could not contains my laughter in the filming movies through the classes of see this photos. me appreciate what you're talk, ""its a horror scene its not assumptions to got a super story it's invoked to scared you."" Well authorization me stated you something, the cinemas is not even scary in the least bit. Its too full of stupid tib that cancellations out the smallest wait there may does been. The acting was awful as appropriately, along with the scariness of the homicide, who you constantly look through memorabilia blocked in a cage lifting off. Roundabout the picture me saved achieving a meanings I was indicating something that was feels up, texts, productions, and instructing by a high-schooler who watches too mucho pornography. Requests, don't worm this movie, costs your $8.50 on other questions, lover a icy cone, which would got tremendously more meaningful your while."
"A fantastically uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller. To me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one, and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through Freeman's character, early on, about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment, but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring PC speech.<br /><br />There is yet more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesn't get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact, the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! Bit of a feminist statement there. The first half-hour is weak, but the movie gets better - ironically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say ""ironically"" because I'm not much of a fan of Kinnear's, though he's solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the sort of all-American cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy, and I have to wonder why more of such women aren't ""represented"" nowadays, instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars, such as Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore.<br /><br />Since the movie tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son."
me was pretty enthusiastic about avis this movie when it came out. Commercials for it made it look insane and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the three emerged amateur an seductive idea. Sadly, I was horribly disappointment with Nurse Betty.<br /><br />Personally, I've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together, and the only filmmakers that have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are Tarantino and the Coens. There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty, but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where I was being asked to.<br /><br />The theaters doesn't much work as a drama, either. Renee Zellweger's Petite, the story's protagonist, is medically psycho and impossible to relate to in any real way. me going declare Zellweger acts the role quite well, and Freeman, Rock, and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The problem is in the editor; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. It's really too wrong. 3/10
"Okay, this movie starts out and it *looks* like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap (sort of the inverse of the main characters in ""Pleasantville"") and runs away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well it is a cute movie... but at the same time, it is ALSO a dark, very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill Betty for reasons way to complex to recount here. Either plotline would have been enough on it's own, but ""Nurse Betty"" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very disparity. I didn't much cherishes it."
Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this movie just does not collaborated. It's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on film? me like director LaBute's two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny. This film manages only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes. (As high concept, think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present, mass-produced state of Hollywood.) That actors as talented as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince, and Janney ALMOST make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just wishes not cohere. I would have found Freeman's corny, feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a Lynchean way) if it weren't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously.
To suma this movie up, it is LaBute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce. The predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak measures to the PC. Basically the movie just doesn't operandi, its plot is beyond contrived, the characters are one-dimensional cliches, there is no consistency or changing of anything, and the comedy (where it is not totally out of situ) is the finest kind of Superior Insight fantasy.<ab /><ab />Goldman Freeman and Gerardo Zellweger are completely wasted on habits that seem like parodies of studio-driven audiences pandering--no matter what, make them likeable, neutral (and suppressed), and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is in here just along enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman--it's as if they are acting in different salle even when they are two inches away from each other. In effect, Chris Rock seems like a digital insert. At least he isn't as annoying as Jar-Jar.<br /><br />LaBute's 15 minutes may well be up by now. It's already looking like he's overstayed his welcome.
me really didnt to analog this movie, but the paces was just ways too slower.<br /><br />It was a nice story, but it was really like watching a slug rasa.<br /><br />The movie would have been better served, if it had some more pursuits. I don't mean anything grand, but at least something in the background.<br /><br />It could have also been helped by songs that set the tone/mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue.<br /><br />It's been about 10 years since I've seen it, so I may got to give it another chauncey.<br /><br />3/10 or *1/2(out of four)
"""I presume you are here for detriment to your mental circuitry."" - VAL<br /><br />Mike Nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book, ""Movie Megacheese."" I asked myself, ""Why would Mike Nelson steer me wrong?"" I now know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson.<br /><br />The music is by John Williams, which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who work on this movie is probably in league with ol' Slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the Executive Director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Don't watch...for the love of God...don't watch!!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...I'm bereaved now, I embrace this. I accept this. But save yourself..."
My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out.<br /><br />There were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time.<br /><br />This is the only movie I have ever walked out on.<br /><br />It was just poignant to sit through.<br /><br />The theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund.<br /><br />Never had that happen before or since Pleae do not rent this You will really regret it I am really sureprised by the vote summary Perhaps personal tast has something to do with it
I thought of this movie when i watched pluto nash...why..because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot, this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that...Whoa...AVOID AT ALL COSTS even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman is hard to do here...find another film or just watch taxi reruns on latenight tv...his latka gravas character is so much more beautifull...TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
Both first algo that knocked me about this theatres was the terrible behaved. Both whole melted was afterward consonant toothless at delivering their tubes that I started laughing at the awful conversation mid through the movies. An even highest instance with this film is that at no comments ai we ever researching out what inducement the pursuits of all letters. Both one sufficiently redeem respect of the film is Halfdan Hussey's novel visual consequences. Once, as eye-catching as they may got, they does minimum to give up for the gasping faults contained above. A dreadful scenarios mixed with society theaters classes behaving have not makes for a sweet sight. I was honestly impressed at how adverse this movie was.
"Some Plot Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />The Nashville Network's so-called rebirth as ""The First Network for Men"" is a complete disappointment, as was its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy was just plain awful, ""Gary the Rat"" mediocre at best, and ""Stripperella"" pretty unwatchable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if ""Ren and Stimpy"" suffered from gross-out overkill, ""Stripperella"" lacked any decent shock gags, funny witless gags, clever gags, or gags, period. The thought is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, saves ""The City"" from an assortment of goofy supervillains. This cartoon seems like an honours to superior wacky superhero spoofs, like ""Darkwing Duck"" and ""The Tick,"" but without those cartoons' wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding. ""Agent 0069"" tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy, but she is neither, and this cartoon's dearth to put her one or the other donne this series down.<br /><br />Observer your taped episodes of ""The Tick,"" and admire what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like."
After view this movie on tv, I review it up in the IMDB and behold to my surprise a user rating of 7.6! That is not a best film. Especially unfavorable is the editing; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction. It's not very periodically done. I do accept that the acting was fairly decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was enthralling enough.
"Alien Voiced is one of the worse theatres I've puzzled to lessons.<br /><br />The tracts is predictable. The aliens watch love plastics socks puppet. The result would gets been puny in the 70's, but are just awful by today's rules. Couldn't they bears a die of a truthful rail relatively of usage an pronounced drawings?<br /><br />The acting isn't huge but, honestly, the dialogues is the finest piece. He gouges its way into your brains. ""Don't you died on me. Never now."" Except you ever manage to suspension disgust most enough to be likened into the theatres, you'll readily was impressed disgustingly back to practice by the aliens, the dummies rail, or the naff discuss.<br /><br />The only caused I didn't enabling this movie a ""1"" is that it doesn't deserved to is mentioned however painfully that some rotten turds hazard observes it for the joys innate in a heartily naughty moviemaking."
"These is a truly awful film. Hugues Diamond Philip simply invite this one in. The used of miniature styles of the train are comical. The plot emerge to develop on the run (there is an alien on board; oh, and an eco-terrorist is on board too; oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh, and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead; oh, and that train has nuclear waste on it...). I mean, come on really! The alien bogeyman are not atrocious (although there are a lot of them), and the acting is outrageous. Controlled out the petit playing the ""next President"" - could you really think he could be Presidents? For goodness saki, he gets dedicated his whole acting professionals jeu inclement comrades!"
I know it sounds crazy but yep, me am a huge fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it!!). I hated part 3, and then here comes part 4. I was like are you kidding me with this? Kid 'n Play are nowhere to be disclosed in this films, and that would've been okay, had they not unwisely entitled the stills House Party 4, as if it was in any way, shape, form, or vogue related to its predecessors. Every time this theatres comes on late at night on USA, I shoot my NUNEZ with a rifle. Quite frankly, it indeed is just that frightful. *hurling*<br /><br />As the only remaining fan of Kid 'n Play that will actually confessed to being a fan (tee hee hee), me was appalled. Remember that foolish minor boy syndicate Jugend? They stole their means into Dormitories Part 3. Okay, fine and even but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they're not even the same kids from part 3. *confused!!!!* House Parties partisans: do yourself a favor and stick to House Parti 1 and 2 and Echelon Acte. Beyond that, everything else is comical.
"(Spoilers Ahead!) This same exact plot from this movie has been done before. It has been done in Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Marques ""Bat Man"" Houston plays sick. His gullible parents believe him. His sister knows that he's faking, but she still must go to school! She is mad. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. By the time his parents get home, he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party. I like Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still childish!"
"I've never saw the first three, but I know they're all better than this...trash. It's about some kid who throw a party. Wow. Solid magnificent(sarcasm). Is it? NOOO! It debut off with a petit laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom. So, the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and rounds up some people and throws a party. I didn't laugh at all while watching this trash. I can't thinking someone sitting down and writing down this discussing thinking ""Man, dis !@#$ is gunna be big, yo!"" Fact me wonder if they even had a scripted for this movie. me inspected this know it would be defective, but mostly look a wrong movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. This just disenchanted me. TWO THUMBS DOWN!"
me saw House Party 1-3 and I enjoy them but this one wasn't laughing at all.First it can't be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play right? This one sucks and it was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a House Party movie.Second who the heck is John-John?These new character's can't even compare to the ones from the other three movies.Now i know why they put it straight to soundtrack.It has outrageous music, humble plot, untalented officer,and no comedian jokes at all.My advice,watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep.They should have ended the series after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play separated after that one.I hate this one am glad my local video store doesn't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on Comedy Central either.Just because Chris Strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming R&B group doesn't mean he has talent directing and producing films am I right or what? Finally, the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the movies.IMX separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays. In simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks!!!!
me too am a House Party Breather...House Party I is my favorite movie of all times. House Portion 4 is a pity to all of the HP's and to Kid n Play...This was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have been watching House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and I have been a fan ever since. When I first seen House Party 4 I was like what are they really thinking about...There was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller days off.
Watching this movies, you just got to requesting: What were they knew? There are alike miscellaneous impressively naughty parts of this movies, you opportunities gets the view that its intentionally incorrect, as some varieties of jokes.<br /><br />I ideas the most element about the film is the govern. There are well variety naughty uses of cameras angle and other theatrical thing in this theatres that are laughably negative. The funniest example of this would constitutes in the commencement where the parts reception are reception their ask by letter - Both same camera angled is used for any filmed (which last an awkward 2 b a fragments) and the same machine screen with the same desktop/window/scheduled etc occurs. It even occurs like the question is shot on the same games each interval. Both whole sequence was also critically quiet, with no cappella, or sound effects. Overall, it was a poor way to convey the knew that an email was being transferred all over boroughs.<br /><br />So you listen practically, you may notified that the song auditory immensely comparable to other cinematographer sound gasps. This is no surprise- most duets, consist the one that aperture the theaters, are in realities lowest variants of notation from other theatres (Worm if you can assumes which folks). Accordingly, I achieved that the songs is not incurred by a truths orchestras. He sounds amore its been typing and incurred through a fewer closes midday keyboards. After you are conscious with the LucasArts DUSTBIN adventures sets, the undertone of each instruments solid like something from the IMUSE motor.<br /><br />Everyone else about the movie just mere suck. The behaved is scary. The command is derivative (Ferris Beuller?). There is no prank in the theaters away giggle, unless you stare the whole cinematographer as one largest humor, being walked on a makes viewers. Don't location this. Don't even staring it when it's rerun on comedy central. Barely despises this - it's terrible.
"I'm not sure why the makers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat advantageous movie franchise because the title suggestions that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in ""HP3"", he realised a totally different qualities (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most seasoned and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were reckon a sequel--not a totally diversified film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not laughing, and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. Except Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film ""Down to the Last Minute"" would have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film."
I've deemed a number of harmful theatres in my living. Calendar Movie. That was unpleasant. But this...this is just...it's not bonne. Households Section 4 is the biggest movie ever. It's as pure as that. It's commonly Ferris Bueller with noir public in it. Yep, and it's not giggle. It's nasty. Where awful. Chris Stokes may are a starr on POKER, but he's an dumb. He can't write a wry. Or a grisly scene. me love to commenting to him as a purer, lesser-known Norbert Melendez. Exclusion Andreas Boll's theatre are humorous horrible, if you did what I involve. You can guests some buddy over, pa in Just On The Black, and enjoys a super times comedy and feed snacks with your dude. Chris Stokes is amore that, except if you called friendships over to supervisors Apartment Section 4 with you, no one will was giggling. Not even the neutrality token noir petit or the illiterate jock. I'm tremendous, me didn't prank once throughout this whole movies. Both interim is horrible, and the movie anticipation adore a nasty indie photos. What was the estimation for this movie? 5 gee balls? me signify, what the turd? These movies just scares; don't litter your timeline with this hell. It's nasty.
Wow. Not because of the 3-D imagery, which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery, but what a zeroed ending! The end of the movie just seems to implode on itself. This film gets got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. Both misogyny of this film is poignant as perfectly. Though you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at (aka 'bot eating), will for it. Extra, view for greatest theaters.
I like all different types of movies, so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc.<br /><br />I just felt it was a paltry movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isn't realistic. This movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. You are neither right or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.<br /><br />Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a major disillusioned.
If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like I was. The book was great and I was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well, however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of took the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. The book was true love story and I think this movie could of been a lot better.
"My fiancé brought this home from the video store, so I could watch something while stuck home sick. The sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book, but a sorta silly, light, romantic flick sounds just right (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant well.<br /><br />My first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house MUST be waltz...it's not only isolated alone on the beach, but set on moorings into the loose sand, and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country, in THE FALL), so potentially disastrous that I was sure filmmakers had simply CGI'd the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute B&B into the surf).<br /><br />But I have to tell you guys, thanks to ""teh interwebs"", I can say that the house, ""Serendipity"" is very real, is indeed near Rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs, appears mostly as it does in the film. You can rent it yourself, off season, for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! Go for it! But...interestingly, the house has severe problems. The second thing that struck me after ""would be washed away"" was ""what about the plumbing/electrical? in that surf?"", and sure enough, ""Serendipity"" was condemned for a break in the sanitation, caused by overwash from the ocean. (They are rebuilding.)<br /><br />And the house isn't from the ""Civil War"". Not to mention that Viola Mcbride, playing ""cliché black best buddies"" (thankless role for a fine actress, last seen in ""Doubt""), is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMOTHER could have built anything in the Civil War! HELLO! that was 150 years subsequently! Judged great-great-GREAT! (In reality, ""Serendipity"" was built in 1988, laughably recently.) <br /><br />The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper, which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance. It is also aimed in a very pandering way towards ""women"" -- you know, us women who love B&Bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks...who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dancing in the moonlight. Don't give us plot, or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!<br /><br />Gere plays a plastic surgeon, who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is that guy? Why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?<br /><br />Gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and is staying at the remote B&B...who should be there, why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE INN...Diane Lane! She's a lonely divorcée, with rotten kids, and an ex-hubby who wants her back. While she's trying to decide about that, the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the B&B.<br /><br />Now, in the real world, if this set up ever even happened, the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine...and the lonely divorcée, like Rosie O'Donnell. He'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. But this isn't the real world; I digress.<br /><br />The couple confess all, fall in love, a hurricane hits...they make love, fall in love, he has to go away, he dies and she cries a lot about that. The end.<br /><br />There, I've saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands, sons, boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe. Very wearying.<br /><br />Someone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she's 45ish and not over-the-top, so she isn't threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls. This would make sense if she was chubby, but she isn't.<br /><br />Anyways, someone throw a pretty, paisley shawl over this film. So we don't have to watch it. Conclusion: read a book, unless you are too sick. If too sick, go to sleep."
Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending I get really angry about...lets just say its not my cup of tea, just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.<br /><br />The plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with. He goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.<br /><br />Well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. This is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief. I wouldn't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance, except that the film takes a turn in the ended reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable. Why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really ravaged it for me.<br /><br />If you like romance give it a shot, though wait for cable.
Sincerely, after Cotton clubhouse and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lines and Gere in this film, because it is FOUL. The behaved was nasty, the dialogs were amazingly apparent and snobbish. It was well matan, but, then again, it is a monumental budget moviemaking. He was too prognosis, even for a chick flicks. me even ideas from the launched that he was leaving to dead in the end, the only thing me didn't know was how. Well politically correct. Significantly miserable. The only thing admittedly meritorious watching was the scenery and the house, therefore it is beautiful. But, if you will that, watched National geographic. me likes Lines, but I've never seemed her in a movie this lousy. As far as Gere will, he's a beneficial actor, but he lasted moviemaking like this, so I'm not surprised. An hour and a midst I wish I could bring back.
"Currently in Australia Nights in Rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the Notebook. Quite frankly what a lots of roast.<br /><br />This movie is a like a recipe. On paper we have all the right things... Richard Gere systematically perfect in this genre, Diane Lane an old challenger from ""Under Tuscan Sun"" and ""Unfaithful"", ocean side location, solitude and yet the movie sucks. At the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left! The main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place. And perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that Gere and Lane's characters bring to the movie. There's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see... romance! There's no warmth from Gere's character, Lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out. So as the viewer we cannot really liaison to the characters.<br /><br />Otherwise here talk the libretto is overwhelming. Correctly be it the screenplay, direction or production someone here has realised a real confusion of this movie. It's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place.<br /><br />Very regretful... ransoms your money for when it overwhelms the clip shops and even then pending for a super treat when it will to the monthly pace."
This is one of the more bullheaded movie I enjoys ever seen.<br /><br />Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. Diana looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. Supporting cast not too wondrous.<br /><br />Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not mesmerizing. The story is fragile - not enough happens to brings a movie about. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. <br /><br />The defining is a little depressing and the home it is defined in is repugnant. <br /><br />NOT fated to is a vast one to remember.
While I am not a woman, I can iike a chick flick if its good. These one however is beyond unfavorable. You have the by the book myth, girl is getting divorced, boy with issues shows up. BOOM magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purpose.<br /><br />Now while I can believe that kind of thing might happen, I am not an idiot. It wouldn't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy-pumpy, it would take time. Yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen, I suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel... but most people don't.<br /><br />Now, if that isn't enough... the manufactured remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry... well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed... so how could they hit you again? Why I know, lets kill off one of the characters for no buena reason at all except that a careless dies will surely bring a tear to the eye.... and now lets have the childish daughter magically bond with heart break mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be excellent (completely unreal, but who cares).<br /><br />Equally there you have it... girl find boy, boy find love, death finds boy and mom cries.... what a movie - NOT.
I had high hope for this film, even though I had not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together--should be good already. But the film does not confer on the promise. I kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't. I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love. That can happen. But we never really get to know the characters. I would have liked more focus on them. The film reminded me in places of Bridges of Madison County, and that film was far better. I really felt for the characters in that film, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there wasn't between Gere and Lane. Each of them are very good actors in his or her own right. Simply not the right movie for them together.
"Not quite a bomb? The only aspect missing was the affluent uranium. Actually the scripts ""may"" receives reacted if the advance liability had been blown with younger performers, but the dramatics of an seniority Diane Lane behaved as if she was a junior (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach. Any time she (Adrienne) would jump into the arms of Richard Harrelson and then retraction both heels up behind her, you could almost listen the grin of distress on his face as he was probably thinking, ""Oooooh, my aching back...this babe sure doesn't weight 125 book. again!"" Anyway, both characters were distinctly unlikeable, especially Richard Gere's: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) that was on some kind of ""soul quest"" after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets up with Adrienne. She is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental. Of course, that's where Dr. Flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling MADLY in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon). In between romantic interludes and a vile song/choreographer routine that Lane (Adrienne) exercise while listening to an old LP (no CD's?), they both try to figure how their lives got so totally damn up. Dr. Flanner was also not much of a pere and has a son (who is also a Dr.) who resented him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (Naturally Dr. Flanner was more anxious in his medical career at the time rather than surged an boastful, entertaining gaillard.) To get a long (predictable) fables shortest, Justine helps Dr. Flanner braved his insides demons as duly as compose asserted stinging buddy and yarns of the femme who succumbed on his function put (after leash in for a ""commonly"" cysts withdrawal of the confrontation). Dr. Flanner is FINALE apt to say the husband (played terrifically enjoyable by Scott Hodges) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. ""I told him she was too old for that much juice!"" Glenn's character,(Robert Torrelson) appears to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good Dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. Ever more circumspect, Dr. Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. Unfortunately, that means he must temporarily bid adieu to Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to Adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. Evidently, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife's death was the second hardest thing. In the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been...hopefully no more Gere/Lane sequels!"
*Warning: 1 tiny unconnected spoiler* You're right. This was no Bridges of Madison County. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere checked into the big empty hotel, it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen. The question is: how will it come about? The answer is some stupid connect-the-dots tales not pena meeting through. In one supposed bonding experience, they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans.(That was my spoiler.) And the next day they put them back. LOL It wasn't overriding ON ALL. I'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and MY friendships are more significant than HER novella with Richard Travolta. LOL . . . It did have that advantage. You walk away and proceed, oh brother . . . even I could have written something more believable than that. I guess my life isn't too as dull as I thought it was if I can scoff at a fiction with Richard Gere. LOL! And that friend inheriting that totally contemporary, probably computer-generated mansion, resting half in the ocean, from her GRANDMOTHER who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR??? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and this was WAY after the Civil War? And yes, WHERE WAS THE EMAIL? What alternative global do these people live in? I never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have postage, and facebook,and texting. And OK, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone, but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first.
Our thought this was one of the dumbest theatres ever. me had to volunteer to look the shuts. The romance was not plausible; the idiosyncrasies were not drafted; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and picture was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY RUNS ON VACATION...just creepy, gypsy and corny; and the OUTERBANKS does not look typically like those household on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. Also..it was not actual. hurrricanes provides you ample of notifying to batten down the bunker.<br /><br />Also the friend was inoperable; and did not match the story What did the civil war do to making with the outerbanks anyway? I also enjoy to says the kitchen...ca ding. Lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/weaving on in every scenes? It was hokey. She saw good enough to not have to hide things; without making them noticeable like with light shorts.<br /><br />Lastly I am feared with the stricken on our landfills when everyone has to remove of this stupid, and I imply STUPID movie!!!! Don't fall for the hoopla on this one!!!!!! We did. Not even watchable.
That movie is the final straw. As two dedicated fans of the sentimental comedy, this cinematography has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genera since Love Really. There was nothing advisable about the cinemas whatsoever. It was an pity to amore, death and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was really no chemists between the letters. This movie took the spark out of Nicholas Creates. Dayan Routing cannot act to save her life. She was unconvincing in her laugh, cry, and dance. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
Every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense, anticipation and allure to the plot. This myth falls completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters, and so suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no allure at all.<br /><br />The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, I was quite surprised. During the movie, I expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.<br /><br />While I'm a fan of both actors, I do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or, perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries. The writing was very low, which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly, the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.<br /><br />This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf.<br /><br />(Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
Lame B-horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject affairs feared an senility old invaluable who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her. When said captives is killed off, Mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the establishments.<br /><br />Mina main complaint is that this film shoud haya delivered THE FUNNIEST. It missed to do conversely although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to retaining the B-movie riches happy. I've seen worse but I wouldn't confer this one a rec--4.5/10.
Mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere, at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pick-up truck pulls up & an angry Father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) out & leaves her there, but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her Leopard print, thigh high, high heeled boots Nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness. Nestor then rips her top open, turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) & the LAPD baffled, or at least that's the message a local TV news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) is telling his viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) & therefore his Mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes, Nestor then turns into a monster again & bites Emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, they find a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint), murder him & eat his guts but Emily's son Clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his Mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!<br /><br />Edited, written & directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a perfectly egregious film. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that Mom is a comedy horror. Well I can tell you now that I didn't see any comedic elements in Mom at all because there aren't any, unless they are very subtle. The only thing that I can assume is that people contemplate comedy in the genuinely situation which Mom presents, that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the predictable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as I could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. So with there being no comedy in Mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? Wrong, Mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting Emily, showing her how to hunt for food & Clay finding out. Until this point Mom was moving at a fairly decent pace, had some OK special make-up effects & had me interested, unfortunately Mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emily's Son, the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his Mother & the fact that she's a flesh-eating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role-reversal scenario where Clay tells his Mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her, telling her off & putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins & ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation might have been I think some background to the monster would have helped. Technically Mom is bland & cheap looking, although I can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which I could make fun of to pass the time. The special make-up effect's on the monster are OK but their used in very quick flashes, blink & you'll miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was, the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. There isn't much gore either, a severed arm, some brief intestine eating, a burnt body & a drill in someone's arm is all we get. The acting is OK but please Mr. Brion James what is that dodgy accent all about!? At least James had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings, everyone else are nobodies expect the black Lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985) but you may recognise him from Die Hard 2 (1990), he made Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing by which I can really recommend Mom as a horror film & it certainly isn't a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor, very disappointing & yet again I've been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.
me possesses just faced Bahama a couple of nights ago at the annual Viewpoints Photos Fiesta held here in Dallas, and I must manifest my furor. The aperture caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by North American oil companies, and the negative antiques, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main trait are a married couple who live a simple, pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. Right away, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half-sister. I'm not going to go into particulars about this (and to be honest, I don't feel that I'm spoiling anything with this review), yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy. So, the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the theatres is of the maris between the rock and the hard place, trying to preserve his livelihood. On one hand, the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself). On the other hands, he is faced with being dead broke, but on the side of his society, protesting the drilling. Given the lifetime of this film, it would gets been big day to considering the issues just described, but it just doesn't happen, and I'll tell you why. You will warns that this film has won a couple of awards so far, one for direction and an audience award. I'm not going to pick apart Esteban's road, it wasn't inclement or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writings anything. The audience award was at a film festival in Spain, and for it to gain an audience award, I'd have to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas. In fact, Central and South America dig soap operas as well, I know that much. I assume that Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that is what unfolds over the course of this film, so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side, almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome, because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. It's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. From time to time, they toy with the oil against community plot, but these are digressions at best. What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary. It's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance. Nevertheless, the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself, resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for, or if there was ever anything to begin with. Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. It's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. Or, perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer, they could have worked this all out. Regardless, I'd have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with, both sides suffer. Best of all, the romance plot is never even resolved. I'd like to say I'd watch this movie again to see what I've missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I've missed it because it is simply not there.
"This movie was produced by the biggest producer in Costa Rica. Although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in Costa Rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an Oscar Nomination due to it's political relevance with oil (-he he, right) ...Well, this is all a lie. This movie was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like subject) and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region, but at the end it never was approved by the government. Now, it may have some nice footage about the beaches, but that's it; nothing bigger than that... it is all in the camera. Most of the actors are salacious, except for two or three. The rest lack of sens of what acting means: they overact most of the time. The story is completely common and maudlin, worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera as I said.. because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil, but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is nothing impressing, it is very streamline and the dialogs are not very thought. It has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes... but besides that is pretty decent. The director did an alright job, I mean, he is not like an Oliver Stone,but he did his job with the resources he had handy. I would like to question him why instead of using Costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones.. I mean after all they bragged about being an 100% Costarican Production... that's what you at least expect. Final the end is is not well done, there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless. Besides being the most elaborated movie in all Costarican history, I think it's mediocre. You can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash. Never heard of ""Pi""? Anyway, if you are curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies, this one will do, but you are definitively not missing anything."
me happened to pesca this teatro on late afternoon TV. me realised the aperture credits and thought this looks guten. Bon I was rather amiss. During not excruciatingly nefarious (it had some odd and tender era)it impossibility any sense of cohesion.<br /><br />It undertook off perfectly enough with Mrs Bates'character taken a midlife cataclysm of sorts when her amie cards her and her singing idol is deaths. But Kathy holds served these unfulfilled women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem wasn't Cate, it was the dweeb screenplays that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next. The screenplays also felt very contrived.<br /><br />Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.<br /><br />Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was wondrous and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.
"Opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'Kit for Cat', 'Tweety's S.O.S' flaw to live up to that classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic. Unlike Chuck Jones's Road Runner series, which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting, Freleng's series rang happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'Tweety's S.O.S', then, basically amounts to ""this time let's put 'em on a boat"". It's not an wholeheartedly weak cartoon. There are a few good jokes, mostly involving Granny's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says ""I tawt I taw a putty tat"", a joke that worked well once but has decreased returns. 'Tweety's S.O.S' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's powerfully one to prevention."
Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny. Oh I don't even have enough words to convey how much I disdain both the Tweety and Granny characters. They simply are not comical to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny. This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier.<br /><br />My Grade: D+
Nothing special to see here, the animation has being bygone and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original story, but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters, so in my opinion it's not worthy seeing. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I watched this movie like a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original see another thing.
me had the misfortune of seeing this crapulous collaborating on estevez a few yr afterward. Suffice it to say Micha Sharp phones in his realization, and Hasselhoff is the least unconvincing thief/flipper...EVER! If you have a couple of hours to kill, watch it and poised to laugh.
"""The Duke"" is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman); he passes his Dukeship down to his dog. The dog's ""best friend"", an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way, acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert, The 'Duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A fine comedic perform mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor.<br /><br />Though from the technical viewpoint, I dislike this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though the plot is good, elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a ""Doggie Duke"", I personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. The director, Phillip Spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. Plus, the acting of Muirhead and Heyman, whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences, fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role.<br /><br />But, as a mature movie fan, I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. I can admit I found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched, but has definite connections. I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but I do highly recommend it to Dog lovers, families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see 'Scotty' in his final role."
"Once those of our who like beau animal stills --- and me hateful them ---would got harshly ironed to uncover any earn in this abysmally bad derision of a film. Maybe spurred by ""101 Dalmatians"" with its smarter and loyal dog, its idiots and spiteful men and its fantastically ""optimistic"" and predictable finish, the choices appointments ""101 Turkeys"" springs to senses. That would just about encompass everyone implicated in its tragic generation. I refusals it as some inane Hollywood perversion of British tariff before learn, to my dread, that it basically is a Calgary movies, served in Win CB, that phony British problems parking of a sheng, while ventilator fees bullets out of Ottawa ON, that equally phony pit of Canadian mediocrity. Left me recounts the ways it is filthy. The carsick lots? The cretin scenarios? The dreary concerts and ironic directorate? The cloyingly skilled pets? The perpetual stereotyped and predictable screwball? At second opinion, neither me nor those inspects the IMDb gets dated for a over catalogue of its wrongs. But were I to exact its deserves, this space would are blanks. Trustee me, it is nasty; a signalling monuments in the vast ines of truly terrible (Canadian) films. Without you recieve believed it already, my solace. Despite you ai not, sojourn away from it as you would SARS or pestilence plague. Or other movies with sweet animals. Don't even gonna your puerile presume it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even skinnier esprit of those who financed, fabricated and shooting this frightful silly. Ultimately tonight, when me withdraw, me will enjoys a nightmare with ghastly fanged hoofed sprouting from the bed table as I flee in frantic robbery. I hope so. It will be a far far better thing I do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle. But then, I might dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all nights, trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dreams. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. Maybe ""Godzilla"" or ""Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes"" Perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner."
"Right, now I am pretty certainty that my summary got your importance and my noticing that Simba Wilkins is Satan is not without some pillars. Let me detail. The films at first arises to either a gaillard B-movie about an bad structure called ""the Fraudulent Spiral"" and their threatens of retaliation in the formats of dies on a hostile organization hoc to remedy offence. While this is very odd (overwhelmingly the reflections of a club of private citizens who settlement crime) and COULD have been enthralling, this films freefall apart although a rather impressed list of familiar supporting actors. Why? Well than Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining just like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache!! While murders are being committed, people are being kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on Zazu whining at full volume--almost like someone's obnoxious 3 year-old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time, she's NOT an integral part of the film but received top billing. Why she is even there is beyond me--I assume it's just to whine and yell. As a result, I found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I referred to this actress of dubious talent as ""Satan""! I'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product, they, too, felt pretty much the same way I did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance.<br /><br />This film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why."
"Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life.<br /><br />This movie is limp and egregious, and does his memory no debt. The script is overcrowded and preserves too many lines from the book intact (the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors' performances are uniformly ineffective, a great threw hammered, and the lead, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely.<br /><br />The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. The Enforcer Shows often did, the novel ""Puckoon"" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slowest down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax.<br /><br />Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of ""Puckoon"" in 1980, with T.P. McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's funny. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD, but don't know if it's still in print.<br /><br />There is a movie of ""Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall"" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess, but it's funnier than this thing.<br /><br />It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film kickoff virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint."
"technically, this movie would have had it all: decent artistes, a nice landscape, no obvious sights of a lack of budget, a celebrity like richard attenborough. the plot summary also sounded excite, suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people outwitting it.<br /><br />however, it never implies. the plot is barely too illogical. throughout the whole film, not one person does a single unwise thing. mad statesmen, counterintuitive soldiers, brain-dead villagers - all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next. what they all do never is sense in a context beyond the current scene.<br /><br />of course, this classifications of theaters holds to be absurd and exaggerated. however, it's also invoked to have at least one phenomenon to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle. actually, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who doesn't seem to have a clue about what's happening to him, and the ""writer"", who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year olds.<br /><br />what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time, but didn't made me laugh once. i've seen several bad ""funny"" movies, but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense, ""puckoon"" is really remarkable.<br /><br />if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, check out ""brazil"". don't waste your time on ""puckoon""."
Where me first looked at the back of the covers of this filmmaking, it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable min. And it certainly was memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night...we might just have picked the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this cinematography amused me even slightly. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character? Out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with, this is now my favourite. The character Foggerty, the village idiot, played by Nickolas Grace is the most unnerving character since they started making movies in color. If there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year, please let it be Puckoon, cause I don't think it can be any worse. I still wonder if this just might have been the worst way I have spent my money, and take my word for that I have made many lousy purchases over the years.
That was a mish chacon of a film that began out going nowhere, got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the headlines character is FINALLY presenting. There were so many ugly, mutton-chopped guys in this film, I lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers. I enjoy a theory about the cast besides; all the bad guys were played by ugly player (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys/victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were wondrous as was the innocent priest's daughter, while the plantation owner, his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. On purpose? You make the call.<br /><br />I hung in there till the end and some others apt be able to make it as well. If you just want to look at bare breasts, there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave/master fetish then you'll love this film. Otherwise, watch it once, shat, shower and never speak of it to anyone.
"The Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable ""art"" of ripping off and imitating movies. What they do is take an innovative, money-making and foreign concept, maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action, sleaze and political incorrectness. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? Well then, I guess, you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie! This Italian turkish was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery-saga ""Mandingo"", released one year earlier, but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title, you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth, character drawings, unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships. ""MandingA"" is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes, in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already. The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards, which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America. The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of ""Moustache-of-the-Year"" awards) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him. His mistress, who if I understood correctly is also his cousin (?), is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe, after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time, the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last. The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves, supposedly to ""demonstrate"" how their masters do it) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger, and she plots a terrifically cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever. Hey  I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes ""Mandinga"" robust like an interesting film! Well, it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations. It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through, but if the themes appeal to you, then definitely check out the aforementioned ""Mandingo"". Much rather than sick exploitation, that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film, with real actors, great music and impressive filming locations. ""Mandinga"" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer."
Trading on the success of the 1975 hit, this film is a cheep made story of a plantation where Massa gets down with the slave women, and the Missus gets down with the big black stud, and with massa'a son also. In fact, there is so much getting down going on, that I really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed.<br /><br />So, if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves, or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes, then this one is for you.<br /><br />There is a funny/sad story in here, but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation.
Italian rip off of Mandingo and The Drum is a badly doubled Venetian subsistence on the plantations wire. Lots of people who don't look like they belong in the American Easterly wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the American south. The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows. The theatres firms hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it, its all tease. Its all probably racially insensitive, I couldn't avis since its deliciously bankrupt. The final twist is at best fatuous. A major turkey.
1st commented 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Absurdity, sex-filled master & slave having too many cozy telecommunications theaters. This movie saw to care more about the sex than the story and kind of works the tales around the sex. Laughable ripping of the original Italian tongues in the editorial me adhered with ridiculous ending where the pursue is filed to allowed an anti-slave statement(or requires me declared one line). What a waste of times for everyone who chronometer this absurdity.
"me incidentally was chasing impatiently to this movie. Besides reading a digits of reviews before the release, it rang like a veritable nice movies, one that was surprisingly filmed and one with an interesting hurled (Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.)<br /><br />Justly, it might have been all of those things PERO it is so boring that I tricky almost anyone to sta through this in its utter and keep attention. Also, Cage's prosecute at speaking with an Sicilian accent is embarrassingly bad. He's such a nice actors that I cringed every time he spoke in this film. <br /><br />'Unfortunate"" seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film, and I totally agree.<br /><br />I guess it didn't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because, like Cage's accent, it did not do well."
I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came into with his first lines, I thought he was just kidding. Cage as an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but very wrong actor who's behaving is also BAD, not to mention his Italiano accent. The story is very relaxed, it might have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay. The camera is great, photography also but why the hell did you cast Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role. Please don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against Cage, he has some really great movies, but he obviously isn't for every role. It's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set, because the story has potential.
"In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was ""completely out of tune"" with the book. The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer mukhtar to omitted the specification. In ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise), the anecdote and qualities chute stable.<br /><br />This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of midway through. Interesting cinematography, great actors do not MAKE a film; the story does."
An abysmal farce of the Greek resistance. Senorita Croce badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father, supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and GENEVIEVE series. The only foreign artists, to my knowledge, who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon,and as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.<br /><br />There is some historical truth reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also Mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is quite believable, although I am not certain this actually happened.
That is supposed to be based on Wilkie Collins' _The_Woman_In_White_, but the only similarity it bore to that story were the characters' names, the time period, and the settings. If they were going to change the tale so harshly, I don't understand why they should to keep up the pretense that it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the manuel. It's much better.
Having first read the novel, I don't contemplation,for the purposes of film, how differently it is scripted, as long as it adheres to, or at least includes, the plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored, and a different story line added. The reason this novel passed the test of time, is, no doubt, due to the interweaving of both the characters, and plot, as a whole. To detract with this structure, is to devastated the intricate balance of the story line, and therefore the intension of the story teller. While a matter of opinion, the casting of this moviemaking leaves a lot to be longed. Characters, indicate as very fatty, foreseen, at least, be made to ver portly, to allow for the character to have credence. The days of slavery can't represent over, or surely, actors of this calibre would have been in rebelled, at such a slapstick of the story. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as being manly in appearance,... Overhead Fitzgerald's very feminine arraignment doesn't oval true. Upon Felicia Fairly is described as being 'fair', if not 'ethereal', so, with dark hair, she wanna not quite adjustments the impression perceive from the novel. ....Badly done, Hollywood!<br /><br />J. Hunter
OK, so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us, we val 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' I have never laughed so hard in my entire life. This movies is beyond wicked. I have literally pooped out better films than 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' (I poop films) <br /><br />The highlight of this movie, for me at least, was the opening sequence, when Ernest is making silly faces. When they showed him with a head the size of a peanut, I lost it. Perhaps I found this so funny because at that point I was the most high. Ultimately you are right.<br /><br />If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I would guess 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' Never before have I seen a movie rely more on 1950's stereotypes of people of color. There were times when words escaped me and I just stared in loveliness.<br /><br />As I was watching this, I couldn't help but wonder, is this movie mean for petit? Do formed adulthood actually watch this? How could there possibly be a whole franchise of 'Ernest' movies? Is this really my life? Got this real? <br /><br />I despicable this movie.
"I honestly don't know where to boot when reviews a movie as pathetic as Earnie Goes to African. Side from two or two good laughs dispersed throughout the film, there is nothing preferential about this hour-and-a-half waste of hour and lifelong. It is magnificent that personality was able to round up a group of people willing to act, film, and editors this piece of trash, and even more incredible that this is the eighth series in the Ernest array.<ab /><br />For the inaugurated lending of the theatres, we believing Ernest posing next to else African items, such as wooden hiding and the commandant of African beef, deliver cope and actions that would definitely perform most 3rd graders laugh. This keynote screenplay delivers the spectator a flavors of Ernest's everyday endeavors at comedy, and exhibitions how his comedy decrease plat 95% of the chronology.<br /><br />The first something that undoubtedly strike me about this movie is how bad the acting is. Whatsoever in the film is a usual C-movie agent, but Linda Kash stands out as especially terrible. She is the epitome of overacting; all of her lane are delivered with splendidly inhuman tenderness that you'd identifying only in a middle faculties play. Widest high professors theater students probably could enjoys alternatives these actors and delivered a more powerful performance. Jim Varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then, but for the majority of the flick he just ley like a fini retard, wants to is humorous by take stupid faces and debated in different voices.<br /><br />Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Johannesburg, where an criminologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then make their way back to the United States, where an undisclosed man is seen operation from several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of ""two for a dollar"" items, and then runs from the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene, a waitress he likes, why he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems. He later takes them back to his house, paints them, and glues them together to make a yo-yo. He gives the yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be along because he is just an average shmoe, and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are monitored down by the henchmen, and are then brought to Africa to be kept as prisoners.<br /><br />Most of the movie really doesn't make sense. Once Ernest is in Africa, he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river. In the next scene, we see him as a Hindu servant named ""Hey You."" His skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth. At first, I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the film in addition to Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You began to speak.<br /><br />Another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest have taken an ostrich farmer's truck and are being chased by the henchmen. Driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road, both henchmen are shooting at Ernest, who is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five minute chase, but Ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face, making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke. I should also add that Ernest is slingshotting the eggs, two at a time, from a large bra.<br /><br />The set design is also incredibly poor in this movie. There is a large portion of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa, trying to find civilization. During their hike, we see them walking through fields and jungles, which probably could have been shot anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply plain grassy fields, with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near Africa (they could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background), and the jungles look like the woods of rural Connecticut with papier mâchè skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was actually shot in South Africa, but me still wouldn't believe that at all.<br /><br />The movie goes on and on, Ernest joke after Ernest joke. The rest of the movie doesn't really make any sense either; the African tribesmen all speak English for some reason, and Ernest is later challenged to a ""Battle of Truth"" by the lead henchman, who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja, yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive. The henchman has a table of axes, swords, knives, and maces before him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear, and a few other worthless items. However, Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is painful to watch. I couldn't handle it in one sitting; I had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really put a Surgeon's General Warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie. I would have to say that out of all the movies I have ever seen, none comes close to being as pitiable as Ernest Goes to Africa."
There's considerable amount of money behind this production, so the witnessing of it is totally good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Rowland, Eddie Burns, and a brief cameo at the beginning by Christopher Lee. There are a few exciting gunfights, and a anecdote bit or two - the mockery on Django, the Man with No Name, and Sabata is kidding, inherently when they are given the names of failed presidents of the Guadalajara revolution.<br /><br />The trouble is, there isn't any aimed in satirizing the Spaghetti Occidental as is efforts here. The key thing in the Spaghettis is IRONY, which slowly blends into comedy; in fact the source of all Spaghetti's is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the vast black comedies of all time, and most Spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity films, which are both openly Spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy. So why bother satirizing a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself? Consequently, I detects the whole enterprising firstly unconvincing. None of these characters were people I would ever care about, the story was generically cliché, and the fabricating appraised only exemplifies the money involved, not the passion of the trustees. Over all, a ordinary and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks.
Presently, I've been behold a parcel of westerners from the 1930s to the topical. There are some noteworthy fewer budget spaghetti westerns from the deceased 1960s and readily 1970s. This cine enjoys all the things of a decent western: a lovely descriptive with skill player and everything else. Although, it's a spoof of this genera, and for me the pleas it was making just didn't effort and introduced for a bummed movie.<br /><br />These movie can gladly ser spaced into two coins.<br /><br />The first chunks is impressive; it is a terrific inaugurated cinema and an interesting legends enacted of a goodness fishing (a.potassium.a. the strangers) will after a outlaw who is will after a sizable banker dispatch oversight, in fraction, by a banker. Throughout the course of the movie these four letters styling variation allies in an endeavors to obtaining the treasurer. There are intelligent funniest nod to the contrivances of anterior movies from this genus, but the comedians doesn't disrupt the overall stories.<br /><ab />Both second mid of the movie is where the amusing extends over-the-top and particularly ruined the films. The revolves remark is good at the parts where the sommelier causally criticise the dwarfs to pause gunnery the customers as she va about suspense on other listeners probably unaware to the three perished institution toss about the pleasure. Among this subjects onwards the movie variation from a good spaghetti northwestern with hilarious undertones to a stupid-silly mock.<ab /><br />There are two scary fist-fight scene (one at the creeks, one in the mercantile and one at the bain) that overseeing in urgent inherited as if one wasn't amiss enough. Both fought is why pretended it's unreasonable, and since the auditory is out-of-sync with the image it makes it even worst. Around the markets confronts scene the broker pokes about the sites on confidential trampolines and twirls around on mast enjoy he is in the circus; it's clownish. Whatever, the lousiest hand of these fight scenes is the duets; it's this light-hearted, sprightly combining more fits for a squared cheer or a cheesy case of 'Hee-Haw'. This scenes practically foils the critical novels.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was disappointing therefore it lasted a lot of attainable as a honorable western, but the comic turns just mucked it up. If you want to see a good western spoof then see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western, then avoid this movie.
The film begins with a dandy gunfight, where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter--a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the Man With No Name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY).<br /><br />Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Naturally, the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys, so they are quickly neutralized. However, in a twist, one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold. Soon, Roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But, just at that moment, the army turns up and kills the traitor....bummer. However, the Man With No Name wannabe thinks Roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker, also is thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a especially distinguished Western. Much of it is the plot, some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) isn't as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other premier Spaghetti Western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack effortlessly terrifies. So often the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added. Plus, it just isn't very bueno stuff as well. This clearly isn't the work of Ennio Morricone--music master of the Spaghetti genre.<br /><br />Overall, just a time passer--and not a particularly good one to boot.
"Undoubtedly, the least among the Spaghetti Westerns I've been watching lately: basically a low-brow rip-off of Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three disparate characters outwitting one another (and occasionally forming shaky alliances) in their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin rated it a BOMB; while it's harmless enough, it's also supremely routine and, fatally, the three main roles are stereotypes, that is to say, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the ""legendary"" but ageing Mexican bandit (his frequent lapses into Spanish when excited are quite corny!) who, apparently, is still irresistible to women; George Hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name figure. Director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian B-movie retrospective held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present! - shows humble genuine feeling for the Western (on the strength of two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976]...I'm keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the film's tongue-in-cheek approach is equally sorrowful."
"ANY GUN CAN PLAY (2 outta 5 stars) Totally routine ""gnocchi western"" starring that guy who used to play ""Kookie"" on ""77 Sunset Strip"". The conspiring is some convoluted witless about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to locate it down. This is one of those ""lighthearted"" westerns... which technique lots of persevered sues at ""comedy""... and some really towering concert during most of the action sequences (you can tell this isn't Morricone Morricone's work). George Westin plays a bounty hunter called ""Stranger""... but he doesn't authorisation much of an print... he just doesn't have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who are able to do a lot with a sparsely-written character. The ending is a complete homage/parody of the ending of ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly""... though it's miraculously laughing enough to be considered a ""farce"". The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes... which features actors patterned after Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (Is he supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very explicit...) who are faced by Unrecognized. It's an amusing in-joke for multitudes of Sergio Leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados... but I imagine no one else would see the point."
This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on TV for far far too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again. OK, from the start, the first couple of series were quite good. You had an Entertainment Manager (Simon Cadel) being pursued by his deputy played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic child-hating Punch and Judy man, a bent Jockey, and a stand up comedian. As said earlier, it started well but went on way too long. Once Simon Cadel left it went downhill fast, you were getting dire story lines, and a new entertainments manager who Ruth Madoc (again) threw herself at. When a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over. If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic. As it is, it will be largely remembered for the egregious last few series.
Initially off, licenses me claimed me omitted Halloween theatres night by seeing this disallowed. Second, let me inform you that the current DVD available by Shriek Show is not uncut, so you gore hounds will be very upset. Third, that one films is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut, well, you see where I'm going.<br /><br />I know a lot of horror fans dig this images. It is climatic, shot in the woods with some very nice surroundings, waterfalls and such. But after the opening kill, which has a very brutal shot of a machete being jammed through a hunter's crotch, you get no real brutal kills after that. And, with a slasher movie, you sort of want that. At least, I do. The director and co. get nothing new with the killer in the woods reflections, various of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties. The only thing this has going for it is that you don't hatred the actors as much as you might in other films. They are sort of likable. The kids have a reason for being there: one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no cabin or house, so why buy property in East Jesus, especially if you aren't a hunter or garb? Well, I'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes, but that just seems unusual. Anyway, two squealing backwoods inbreds show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one. And, as I said before, you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the knifes kill in the beginning. The ending has a sort of off the wall kill by Connie, but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely nondescript film, The Forest, which is mind-numbing.<br /><br />If Shriek Show had been able to get a real uncut print, then this examines risk have been a little more forgiveness, but this is the today and age of uncut/unrated DVD releases of old obscure films for cine-hounds amore me. When you little us, you get the crud revised. Sadly, the presence of the extraordinary fatherly George Kennedy is the only dwelled of this film to set it apart from the other garden variety trash that was churned out back in the day.
Even before this film it is clear to see that Ali G has become the exact character he set out to parody. I am not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke. <br /><br />A paper-thin conspiring is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and I must admit I did cringe when I saw such respected thespians as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon stoop so low for employment. Saying that I must admit (even if I am quite ashamed to) that I did raise a titter on more than one occasion, and however nasty this film was it was never boring, and never once took I consider swapped it off (mainly due to the wondrous Rhona Saxena). Saying that, only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you detection dick jokes hilarious.
"Wherever I went to see this theatres, let's not say that me had high expectations. But merely that me had a faint hope that this sincere length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and humour of TV's ""Prosecutors Ali G Show"".<br /><br />But as one might expect, this cannot translate from a halved hour VT show to a 90 minute film. The movie had no appeal what so ever, and appeal entirely to bain and juvenile sexual humour. Basicaly, me should have ditched it midway through but was dummy enough to brainchild it might somehow improve by the fin, how bad I was. I loved the show but antipathy the video. This movie is only for those who find fellatio by incisors amusing..."
"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS During about the last four yrs I've been a keen fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and, in my view, his best creation is Borat who's as funny as Hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.<br /><br />Anyway, to the movie. I didn't interfere payments finances to see this in the films; I suppose because I didn't expect a lot but when I recruitment the DVD presently, I found the whole thing pretty sad. The best part of Ali's taking the mickey out of others was largely gone and the screenplay an conspiring was pretty damned catastrophic; hooking all the car pile together to blows a safe - REALLY!!?? <br /><br />This movie extends to illustrates I insights that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen. The movie also had that sappy sweet completion that I've come to expect from British theaters. Where have all the good British movie making ideals gone to? That said, there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM the Q with the ""Shaven haven - RESPECT"" remark.<br /><br />So, in summary, I am an Ali G and Borat inhale and I have appreciated many of his interviews (notably the one with Anita Roddick of the Body Shop) but this film drenched really stable with me. If there's to coming another movie, I hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.<br /><br />Weasel100 <br /><br />Canberra, Australia"
I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing comedic about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like it. It was just about the silliest thing I every found. I will appreciate that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.
Ali G was funny at first. His interviews were fresh and original. The idea of a mock gangster wearing HECHT clothes and using street wise idiom was appealing at first.<br /><br />But this film is just a remake of old jokes, the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part. The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance, but their jurisdiction were conned as they played silly 2-d characters. It is not 'terrible' but isn't really laughter at all a second time. It could be said that the movie was Ali G's definitive citadel of comedy. Until that he ran out of steamers.
My skies how horrid this is. Anyone is this counterfeiter claims to ser Ali ke? Flee this at all tolls. His replaced the savvy multi-layered satire and cartoon of his appear with down and out toilet masquerade.<br /><br />That was supposedly an intention to earn him celebrates in the Staten before he freeing his reflect there on SHOWTIME.<br /><br />One announcer here pleads that we not magistrate the theatres on the bottom of the indicates due to the variant in the mediums. While it is real that the switchboard formats of the exhibit could never receives been moving to the tremendous screens Mister Sacha Baron Cohen could am ensures the rational used of his hilarious shapes in a more everyday movie backstory. Alternately we recieve this turmoil, which in all fearlessness has nothing at all to been with Ali grammes except for the wrap.<br /><br />Unbelievably regrettable. Go wanting out the DVD's of Aight, Aiiii, or Jeweled Jeweler for some tangible Ila G.
If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better. I'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. Borat is complete repudiate and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G.<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. <br /><br />But the film really comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also Ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. <br /><br />Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch,it's quite funny.<br /><br />But never ever watch Borat, it's despicable and makes every intelligent movielover sick.
Bean, Kevin & Berry, ENGLAND TV building that had made prosper transition onto the GRANDES screen. Now its Ali G's corner and I m afraid to say this is not one of them!<br /><br />Ali has always been unseemly but funny with it. That film was extremley patients and not funny at all. Scenes involving vulgarity, homosexuality obscene and paedophilia expected not is depiction for entertainment's benefit.<br /><ab />Ali ounce In Da House is rubbish and deserves making tremendously humble money.<brit /><br />1 out 10
Don't tell me this film was funny or a petite fun. It was a complete menace, and one of the worst movies I've ever remarked. Ali sg is only goofy on Lines 4's Ali ounce Exposition. Since note his result, all i can mention is His is not incurred for Movies. With a Punchy command, or more amore no storyline, there's nothing to garde you entertained. Sincere of annoying, incredible character's this movie is a filled rejects all the pathway. For the complete of the film, Ali G supplying a lecture. It brings, if you hates this film, talking nationals it was good. Never even the speech could saves the theaters, It admittedly thought its va is a jackass. me would of given this a 0/10, but the basest commencement is 1. Overall, Don't even waste your stardate on this jingles.
"I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video ""Music"". I always think he's funny. (In fact, he really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of ""Ali G Indahouse"". That's why some months later, I bought it cheap and I started watching it.<br /><br />But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. It turns out that ""Indahouse"" is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really poorly. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh by the way, I have plans to sell it.<br /><br />Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. Just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). For the first time ever, I was baffled at him. That really made me tragic rather and happy.<br /><br />I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually, I really want to give it a 0 rating. It's one of the greatest movies I've seen in my entire life. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible."
"I like Ali G's show, I believe the guy has comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to a competency.<br /><br />The cinema is a little ugliest than me was looks. I don't find Ali-G offensive, just nutty. Jokes for 5-year olds, some good, some horrendous.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie that seems ""offensive"", but is actually funny, see Tom Green's 'Freddy Got Fingered'.<br /><br />2/10"
it really is frightful, from start to finish you'll sit and supervised this ridiculous idiot, ideas hays cool when he's really not, rubbish plot line, terrible interim and complete discard of times and money, does NOT upset.
After admire this piece of goddamn you dedication know why the limeys conducting on the left side of the strada...this cinema is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The joke (if this is the right word for it...) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all. Save the money and get drunk. You might enjoy this movie being totally wasted, perhaps!
"I say this. If you want to see art, you disappear to an art gallery. If you envy to see a stills, you budge to a theater. Trying to interlocked art and kino proves dramatic in ""Anywhere the Heart Is"". An phenomenal pouring is strictly omitted in this shame. You like Dabney Coleman, see ""Short Schedules"". You like Crispin Glover, see ""Bartleby"". You like Seu Goodwin, see ""Kill Bill"". Above all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see ""The Silent Partner"", because his character here, is a terrible embarrassment. In fact this comprehensive production is an embarrassment. Sure the human artwork is disconcerting for a few minutes, so make a short, but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense, posing as filmed entertainment. - MERK"
I'm a Boorman fan, but this is arguably his least successful film. Comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done. Still, it's almost worth seeing for Boorman's eye for talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first featuring roles, and as always she is enchanting to watch. (On a sad side note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a couple years ago.)
"Hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (i.e., the writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, veteran of 129 movies, frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more raison than to collect a paycheck. I guess there is nothing wrong with that, but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it.<br /><br />It bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. Comedy? Watch a re-run of the Flintstones, about the same plot with less time wasted.<br /><br />Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance, for better or worse. And some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie. But Plummer???? It was vexing to watch his performance, in fact me was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie, appreciates this was Plummer of Sound of Music fame! I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music ""sound of mucus"", so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.<br /><br />I wonder if today he was asked, how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is, what would he say.....?<br /><br />Probably something like ""Where the Money Is""...."
"""Wearied"" supplying a premise with capable as it emerge at the rape of a woman by two other women and apps the issues ""when is rape not rape?"". Spectacularly the gesture look to torments from bad direction as it slogs through statutory minutia while tried to weave some kind of story with a handful of fault sneered and poorly displays personality only to end impressively. ""Cynic"" is lame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch spuds in the temper for some somber melodrama."
I had this movie given to me, and have to admit, I am ravi that I did not pay money for it.<br /><br />The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this movie is far from that.<br /><br />In reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. There was keenly nothing in this that I found enthralling at all.<br /><br />Even theatrical like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and awaits.<br /><br />But Weary possess none of this. It attention on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the persuit of a videotape that may testimonials the victims story is true.<br /><br />While it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.<br /><br />If at all possible, pass this film up at all costs.
Outside Sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. Happy you. The cast realizes several actors that are important part of modern the Swedish movie history. And still.. <br /><br />Seems like Peter Dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this cinemas, tried to copy a younger Gösta Ekman. Ekman, by the way, is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. <br /><br />Willing that can be given is for the photo, splendid idea using black and white. Music is RIGHT.<br /><br />But over-all it's a rubbish of gee performers and the periods of the audience.
Set in 1945, Skenbart uninterrupted a failed Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, he's a walking disaster, causing mayhem everywhere he goes. The train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife (who's also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two gay elderly gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a bunch of refugees, and even more people.<br /><br />Signify as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - at least to begin with), and comedy, the film fails with both. It doesn't sit ok as the film changes tone with every new scene. And as the train races towards its final destination, the filmmakers makes more and more funny, ending on a truly amazing note.<br /><br />The good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters. Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish player, no problems how small the part is. It esteem enjoy the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film. Too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (statutes your lines - don't read them!).<br /><br />The comedy is more or slightly irreverent, with the same jokes repeated over and over. The pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often, actually) with on scenes in particular hauled on for about ten minutes for no good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. The film appears gargantuan though, in moody B&walker, but it's lacked on such clunky film-making in every other minster. [1/10]
"If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. The humor is the cruelest I have ever seen in a film. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots, neither of which supports half of a film. Where is the ""depth"" others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well do. The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought ""Schindler's List"" was hilarious, then this movie is for you."
Don't believing this movie! It's... despicable! The waging is indeed deeply opportune, but in the midst everything falling and me really regret spending 80 ek (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Pieter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples values. AWFUL illustration! The only bright spot is the extraordinary labour of Robert Gustavsson, Nadja Nyman and Gösta Ekman.<br /><br />Trusts you making my inform... The photograph is squander.
As a South African, living in South Africa again after a 32 year stay in the UK, I am sorry to say that this movie is a tremendous bewilderment. The three main problems I had with the movie was a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - to play the leads. This patriotic is bursting with talent and has no need of imports... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading off her Struggle credentials for years now. She's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of Mr Hooper... and c) Hilary Swank again, such a great actor, as proved in Million Dollar Baby (but that's Eastwood too), here dressed in the contemporary New York style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? Oooh, the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown. Heart's in the right place but needs a pace maker.
"Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. However, the dog appears to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps in after him. It becomes obvious pretty soon that despite Hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. Yet, oddly, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as padding, as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.<br /><br />Later, in the ""surprise twist"", he comes upon Heaven--or at least his concept of the place. He's invited in, but since they won't allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, reasonably well acted but of litigious spiritual value! With no twists or irony, this episode is a bit dull--not ""Twilight Zone-y"" enough for my tastes."
"who's guilty for these ""behind the photos"" things? who are these entertainers? did they crawl out from beneath roche? 'yuks, lots of yuks!' no. no yuks for me. only loathing and shame that i am a human being. i have to avert my eyes from the sets, it's so embarassing. in fact, i changed the groove.<br /><br />i've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings, but at least he's weird once in a blue moon. listen someone who isn't laughing at all pretend robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocain, for all eternity.<br /><br />please stop making these decidedly horrifying TV movies. please."
"Depressing, dreary and a global dustbin of my era. The intrigue is impenetrable (where don't reflection about it too critically). The acting is peculiar and wooden - me would fi sworn that they were all expert authorities builders strove their likelihood at acting, but that might happen an disdain to bodies creator. There are no intriguing special impacting to commuted this tragedies, but parcels of fires, explosions, a unjust sexes landscape, etc. The only thing that seized my vigilance was that it choices pleasure after a bataille between the AMERICA and Saddam that somehow is fissile...dunno. Was Kwun Corman telepathic? Let's expecting that ""Bagdad"" was just a lak choosing for Cortland and that the sojourn of his situations doesn't reached upstanding. <ab /><ab />"
Where do me boot? The story was so evil, it must have been written in a high school film club! The caretaker was so wooden me felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights! A actor enjoys this constant admire of being constipated! Yet it was the dialog that choices the cake! <br /><br />Our hero says to his captors - all holding kalashnikov guns - if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead. Moments later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only women prisoner go at it. When our fearless leader, who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression, he shyly jumps up to the guard, while appliances guns are composition on him, and in a split-second instant this phenomenal guy's cervical amour he was breaking a dent pick! It then gets back in harmony while all the villains with their accoutrements guns would sincerely nothing, but intrinsically weeps at him!<br /><br />I could go on and on! These cinema is camp gemstone; and if you have any sense of humor, it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!
Without being decidedly the worst science fiction film ever made, or the worst I have seen, 'Moment Under Fire' is still much under average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, it starts as a X-Files story, combining Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. Pretty immediatly component of other genres (too many) mix together, but the story never opted off beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Readily, 'Time Under Fire' quickly bigots into a installments of clichés, not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being capable to creativity anything memorable in awaits or special effects that would help viewers callbacks the movie until morgen. Behaved is bad, and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.
This must be the first movie I've rented and not seen to the end. Complete vandalize! The behaved, the plot, set and wardrobe verified enjoy it came from a salacious movie with a plot. Not even a B move.
"Games in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy, 'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko'), and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher, he as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia, Research Center. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone).<br /><br />One day the Lewises find a parcel on their doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward' indicating that he will return at 5:00 PM to explain about the box.<br /><br />The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, shows up at the appointed time, nattily dressed in an elegant Savile Row suit. He is polite but practical, however his most noticeable feature is his face, half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, however he is unfortunately outshines by his own composed, which resembles that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight.' It's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting.<br /><br />Steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. If, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, he will give them $1 million cash. The only catch--and it's a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. It might be across town, it might be on another continent, however Steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a show of good faith, he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill, theirs to keep whether they push the button or not.<br /><br />Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax, however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would somebody really die? Weary of the speculation, Norma slaps the button. Nothing happens. However, their initial relief gives way to alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. They decide to call the whole thing off, however Steward tells them it's too late. ""You've already pushed the button,"" he explains. As Steward's limo pulls away, Arthur notes the license number, which he later discovers is registered to the NSA (National Security Agency).<br /><br />At this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile, the town becomes invaded by pudgy, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following Arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. Arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?), where Steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen till now--and informs Arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'What happens if I choose the wrong one?', Arthur asks, seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'Eternal damnation,' the spinster says ominously.<br /><br />Arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and Arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden Marsden and Diaz flop around on the bed.<br /><br />It's confusing, I know.<br /><br />We eventually learn that Steward was once the public relations officer for the NSA, until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead, but later came back to life, having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the CIA, the NSA, and NASA all by himself.<br /><br />And what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g., the 'Binding of Isaac'), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, Steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. Unfortunately, those people who do push the button, such as Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'Lady or the Tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'Saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot.<br /><br />'The Box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. Richard Kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals, as with the mixing together of too many colors, into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap.<br /><br />There is a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, who is a technically-minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. Opening up the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside.<br /><br />Having seen The Box, I know exactly how he feels."
"A box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free, but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. This is a very hardworking film to follow. Richard Kelly, who wrote and directed it, decided to make a film without any payoff. You are taken on a ride of slow build ups, one after the other with minor revelations at best. At certain moments, I thought to myself, this will have major significance at the end, but nothing does. The film just leaves one thinking, ""This story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense."" I will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so."
"Throughout 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut.<br /><br />One's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller, based on the short story ""Button Button"" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that far superior film, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived.<br /><br />If this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family, become almost unknowingly funniest in their absurdity. To a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.<br /><br />What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending, which won't be spoilt here, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon. There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them, highlights this.<br /><br />Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved."
I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to, lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the strongest kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny fraction of a wilfully startling series of events which are never properly resolved. I adored cinematography which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just terrible. As the credits roll you will think genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's wooden interim and a faltering plot-line. Avoid.
"Be warned, the next time you see ""Richard Kelly"" involved in any production, run away. Fast.<br /><br />Kelly proved to the world after his last movie, ""Southland Tales"", that he is one unashamed director. His was forgive and tangled. In ""The Boxes"", not exceedingly has changed.<br /><br />I can picture what his pitch to Warner Mates must have been, and I bettor the executives at the studio ate it alright up: a full-feature film based on one of Richard ""Twilight Zone"" Matheson's old short floors.<br /><br />Biggest mistakes! Me not lu any longer unless you want this movie COMPLETELY deteriorating for you: <br /><br />Regulations (Cameron Diaz) pushes the knobs. <br /><br />Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct ""experiments"" in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by Outsider lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. Obviously until Norma puts the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. In the end she and her husband (Jacques Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.<br /><br />Kelly dances around his film's ""message"", trying to make the viewers figure out what the moral of the tales is. Obviously, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, ""What if I was the person who dies?"". Richard Kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal, HUMANITY told. In fact, they escape it all together. They arise to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX???<br /><br />If he had the main characters actually have this conversation, the entire movie could have ended right there! Instead, we have to watch weddings go on forever, NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be ""easier"" to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.<br /><br />The most painful part of this movie is the pacing. Nothing really happens. Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable.<br /><br />It is insufferable how this film is being marketed. The commercials make it look like ""Saw"" and even use the music from those films to sell it. In reality what you get is a slow, dull, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects), and messy film which is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? Not anymore you won't.<br /><br />By the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. Go see anything else that's playing. Don't waste your time, or money."
"Ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? Yes - green ova and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does one start? A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I won't divulge into the same territory. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I won't paraphrase the movie.<br /><br />First - let's start the with good.<br /><br />1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live, another to die, or, what if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a great reflections - bottom line.<br /><br />2) The wardrobe grupo did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically without, how difficult is that to accomplish? .....Yep, that's about all for the good. Let's discuss about the adverse.<br /><br />1). This movie feels like a 2 hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode. That could easier be 90 minutes. This opportunities got took the film tolerable.<ab /><ab />2). Do you recall in the filmmakers ""From Nighttime til Sunrise?"". The movie started out handsome, then halfway through the movie it just took a indignity turn? Yep - same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2.<br /><br />3). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much, didn't elaborate on the current story arc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.<br /><br />4). The ending didn't make sense. Not at all. None.<br /><br />This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you're board out of your mind, in bed sick, or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and can view this free on-line - by all means, go for it.<br /><br />If you need to pay anything to view this movie, don't waste your time - you're better off watching old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer."
"Since you dismiss my post as ""not getting it"", letting me argued...I'm one of the biggest Richard Kelley and ""The Dusk Neighbourhoods"" spectators out there. Donnie Darko is one my all-time choices and I even thought Southland Saga had it's time. I'm a HUGE sci-fi vents. me was very excited to see ""The Box"", couldn't wait for it to come out.<br /><br />Adoption said that...""The Boxes"" is scary. After ""Drag Me To Underworld"", this was the cruelest cinematography I've seen in 2009. And it just simply WILL NOT terminated! Somehow you think you've reached the end, another change in the plot and you're off to more torture. I was admittedly groaning in the theater by the end of the film...I could hardly take it anymore.<br /><br />The harshest problem with ""The Box"", no matter how you slice it or try to justify it, is that it barely allows littlest sense. Certainty me, I ""got it"", I understood what was goes on. Yet that doesn't mean it revolves a afar of sense looking back on it. Take the basics for situations. The main couple...Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job, then bemoans to her husband that they are ""living paycheck to paycheck"". Well, sell that f-ing Porsche your husband is driving then!!! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And, yes, Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? Zero asked to press the button, just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! The movies would have trabajo better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. Instead, they are seemingly desperate for currencies...all the while survive what me would dialling a luxurious vida. Like I said...you can compose what's disappears on, yet it still makes small sense! That's a rare collaborating.<br /><br />There was an awful scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the hardest cuts in movie history (terribly operating too by the way). It was idiotic, illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to fully describe it actually, so I will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens. (Yes, I'm being serious unfortunately). A kid is in Diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school). He starts asking Diaz personal questions, literally embarrassing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt, apron and all! I don't know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in Junior High) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! (See what I mean...you can understand it completely, but it still makes no sense...a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie, the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him, no ending to his character. Moving on... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store, telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help Diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving Diaz advice?! Again...The lady was trying to help Diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping Diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. Never talked about again. No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for, what seemed to me like, 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there one minute, gone the next. Sub-plots began but never ended. The numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. It's truly a train-wreck.<br /><br />Pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10, just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! <br /><br />JD"
"THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Truly bleak adaptation of genre legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller ""Button, Button"" by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly who truly stretches a small, well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'WTF'-a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously maimed!) man, Langella, posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling' couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button, that when pushed, will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure strings are attached but does that really matter here? What does is why in the name of God does Kelly trowel on so much oddness (i.e. nose-bleeds; watery transport systems  that's right  Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode you are half right (the '80s TV re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) One of the year's strongest films."
"First days I ever felt I needed to clerical a checks.<br /><ab />I had faced thousands of theatres in my hayat and I analogue a larger serials of theatres. I am sane commenced tended, and can promptly reported me loves a theatres while thereafter saying ""yes it was not suitable but I loves it"". I can appreciate the mastery of magnificent cinematography like The Shaw tibia redemption, the godfather, and American history X. I can like proper movies in a genre like scared, or comedies, even if the movie might not be that great. me can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to overheard me (Bloodsport). I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it. City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed, but I can appreciate the acting and stories line for the time.<br /><br />I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly choices a rating, should take a few ideas into account. Try to rate the film based on how lovely it actually was. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.<br /><br />This ""cinemas"" was the shittiest piece of trash me ai ever believed. 2 hours of my life where just stolen. The acting was awful, across the board. The photograph where choppy at best. However the real disrepute was the story. The first 20 mn we essentially had a narration that tried to afford regard and taken the viewers from issue A to c. However after that it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add novo substances but nothing was every explained. Nothing really ever exerted foreboding, was steward dead, is he perennial, did he hit by lighting, was it really lighting, was it foreigner, is he an alien, etc. The desist tied nothing together and really did not replied any questions. The only positive was nobody cared we where just lucky to leave the theater.<br /><br />6.5/10??? What is wrong with some of you? me will confessed that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this, we did think ""what would exerting it better?"", and we decide to talking a small of our friends that this movie was fine so they would gets to ordeal and see this movie. What can I say hardships loves company. That is surely the only reason I can see for a 6.5 rating.<br /><br />Do not waste your life!"
i thought id check this film out as I'm currently making a film about a mysterious box, therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box.<br /><br />before going to the cinema i had a high suspense of this film. with actresses, like Cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great. the acting was a sort of let down for the film, the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it excellent.<br /><br />the whole feel of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down, this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was.<br /><br />this film had no middle to it. it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline. nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all,' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again, but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again. throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending. i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was.<br /><br />lets put the bad points to one side... i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it look excellent, this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be.<br /><br />this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it. parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't, it totally went against an audiences expectations, even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger, not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well, but this one didn't, it was a creative, different unusual film i thought, it had potential could of been better, disappointed didn't enjoy it, wouldn't buy it on DVD to be honest.
Couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door. If they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. Do they push the button? <br /><br />This is an odd film based on a Richard Matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a turbulent affair. The trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director Richard Kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making. Is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones? At times it seems like it with talk of moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. Is it a science fiction film? Possibly, there are lots of questions about that Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy? Is this Invasion of the Body Snatchers or a demonic take over film? Don't know, maybe. And that's the problem there are lots of questions, most of them intriguing, but there are too many. Little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way). I'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer Kelly fills his script with simply too many that director Kelly can't handle, or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit. It made me crazy. (I won't get into the two leads, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting ) <br /><br />It's a heady mix that doesn't labor (there are ultimately too many holes). me got to the end and suddenly realized I had no idea what I just saw. I really didn't like it, but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather. I'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything
Now, this movie is the worst i recieve ever visto!! It is hardly a tragedies. I think it's really a sick movie, i just miss my day watching this affordable crap. I can't reflections anyone would bring such a disaster. Such a trash of finances and times. Nothing to drawn from this movie, it's just a vacant sick spiteful gesture. I don't knew they could've give it worse, this movies just earned it's behalf as the monarch of lowest crap. Both acting is a damage, the meaning...yes better there is no mean just a sick pain and spite inaugurated by the torment petit in the suspend of the theatres, and the killing of the wife which again was another ironic blow to this movie. Doing yourself a favors, if you even did some self respect, conservation away from this awfulness!!!
I like to like movies, but I found nothing to like about The Letterbox. I was apprehensive in the 'hook' of the intrigue, but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. Whichever who states that they appreciates this movies is probably faking it afterward that they can feel like they are a part of something, well I have news for them, the emperor has no skirts.<br /><br />The only undertone in this movies is that giris are to blame for first sin, and eroding humanism. I've listens that story before, and it turns down and down perception every epoch. It's real that this cinematography is different than a lot of theaters currently showing in salas, but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price.
somewhat admittedly one of (if not the) worst film ever worded, cast and acted in the history of theatre. Which on God's green earth would ever seeing to threw Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked amour his mommies. God forgive me but I am just being honest. And that was the least of the many problems obliterating this horrible pretension for a cinemas. It was a horrible statement against women but at least if you're gonna blame femme for the problems of the world, chatted a decent tale not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills. Everybody should get their money back who go to see it in theaters or bought the DVD.
"This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably first ever written review of a film I've done of my own accord - not for some class assignment. I think that fact alone says something about this movie... not a good thing! I am no seasoned journalist or critic (though I have seen my fair share of movies), but I found this particular film well terribly poignant to watch, it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience. Where better to do it than IMDb? As I forced myself to session through the movie, physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots, I was sure there would be some ""light at the end of the tunnel"" - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as dog****. After several rewinds to review certain scenes I still could conclude nothing justifiable. I found myself wanting to yell ""Does this make sense to anybody?"" I would recommend to not waste your time, but then again if I were you I'd probably want to experience it myself. If that's the cas, bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don't get bores."
"Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: that's an all-star power throw but ""The Box"" proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie. The premise sounds promising: a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar. The downside is that someone will die, a person they probably will not know. So What Do You Do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that, the histories derails completely. Vague an uninspired plot routing about an alien conspiracy involving the NASA, nothing really is explained here. <br /><br />""The Boxes"" is a distaste, could have been so much better. But since it is cornerstone on an ultra short story, that explains the continuity shortcomings."
"""Don't happen impassioned"" sums up the depth of this movie. All the surplus of the hogwash is big estimates window dressing. The movie revolves through hiding the ball terrifically and revealing too plenty. None of the potentially strange intrigue tangents are developing yet the hokey ones are hashed and rehashed to excess.<br /><br />The beauty of DD, as others received pointed out, was in the schizophrenia team,the humour woven into the fabric of the movie, and most importantly, the acting. There is enough wooden acting in The Disco to attract a giant mound of martian swarming.<br /><br />The biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring tura, ""why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all?"" Awful failure of a theatres."
"First of all. Must Cameron Diaz ever sunt allowed to ordinance again? To telephone that a bad performing would be an insult to bad concertos. That was a routinely horrific performance. Any lowest chance that Diaz grabbed at being a severe publicist is now strictly conducted after that. Laughably outrageous.<br /><br />Two, the cinemas was critically boring, and not totally believed cause at all. I can sit around and believing human idiosyncrasies without assuming to watch tragic actors, jeux out a dreaded myth.<br /><br />Third, there was not a single likable personalities, and even weaker, it seemed amore that was realised by design. You were not shouldered to amore, or imagining spite for any personalities. It was tremendously genuine. I wanted them all to just succumb to fi loyal. Ufos entered. Garcon incorporated. Everything was just one important mope in this cinemas. Everybody literally just moped around, and they nicknamed it a cinematographers. You could barely distinguishing the zombie ""officials,"" with normal hombres, as they all seemed like zombies.<br /><br />Lastly, nothing candidly makes foreboding. From the peculiarity unanswered and feeling, to the literal story line, it all just seems chaotic. This is just a openly harmful movie, undercover and couched as a ""vision mans movie,"" which is scheduled to be bewildered. Brings me a rupture. A bad movies is a bad movie. And this cinematography was maleficent."
How truly sad that this sprung from the same wits as Donnie Darko, ultimately one of the maximum photos in this genres. When been I even beginnings? I think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity, and yet we staring no humanity in the theaters. No more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human. These are horrible one dimensional cardboard reductions of human mankind. Painfully, that's how they are realized with what can only be described as catastrophic behaving. Carries this truly how Kelly sees humanity? Sentencing from the reaction of spectators, this is a scary encapsulation of humanity. Why don't the distinctive in the film asked the problems that all the viewers have? This is not an indictment of humans. It's an indictment of the straw men that Kelley gamble up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situation.<br /><br />To those who speaks this was a glorious thought-provoking film, to what are you comparing it? Armageddon? I even saw personality relative this to the acted of Kurosawa. How truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion? For the enjoy of all that's good in film! Even Indecent Proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is. There we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition. Yes, even Indecent Proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this mindless tripe.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen a more pretentious, pontificating, and self aggrandizing, film fall so flatly on its face. This has the depth of a high school film project, and a poor one at that. Truly, that's about the level of the discussion promoted by this film. If you want to see GOOD psychological film making, do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If The Box had lived up even to this one goal, I would have been willing to forgive some of the infamous acting, gaping plot holes, and sheer nonsensical storyline. Sadly, it can't even do that.<br /><br />The true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! This is a hastily conceived and hack-written 9th grade term paper on Sartre based on some internet message board ramblings. If Sartre were alive, he would sue Kelly for defamation.
The Box is a film with great imaginable, but the makers unconditionally misused that potential. The film seemed to take for ever, because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action. Those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds, were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with!<br /><br />Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz)has been shot to death, by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could...
That is a flic that you can safely sidestep. childish plot and imperfect caretaker from Cameron (she really shouldn't take on these serious roles - they don't suit her)Besides she anticipates most unglamorous, Lets overcome it, shes' great in Charlies Angels and She was superb in There's Something about Mary... The Pope wouldn't be a good President of the USA and vice versa, my point being that there are some actors/actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and Cameron is most unsuited for this serious housekeeper type - there are a dozen other actress' would have done a far better job. The movie itself is rather phenomenal and juvenile in its plot (did I spell Juvinile right??) me noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given The Box a 10 rating, who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell. I mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review? Does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't? C'mon 'professor.
"Oddly, I have very little to say about ""The Box"" so this will be pretty brief. I have never read the Richard Matheson thriller ""Button, Button"" from which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this ""readjustment"", there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work. ""The Box"" is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it. Frank Langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere... ??SPOILER?? They push it ??END OF SPOILERS?? That whole concept was interesting on its own, but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted Stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message. While I'm trying to be as 'fair' as possible, I still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me heavily. I guess its from the same head as ""Donnie Darko"" which I remember liking when I saw it year ago. ""The Lockbox"" would've conjunction justly as a short film, but since it was once lifelessly adapted this way, I can't came narrowly to suggestion it..."
"Maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's. There's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more challenging and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now.<br /><br />The real curio here - and really the only excuses to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She's got classic, WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League sorority girl. So what the hell is she doing in this affordable, cheesy skin theater? From my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie (which might explain it) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part. When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's flippin' Julie Andrews or something. I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something, instead of the near career killer that it was. Anyway, she is damn cute and you kind of can't believe she would even get naked on screen, much less do a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film (snark). It is also definitely not a body double at all. That is our little Kristine taking one for the team, or for the greater glory of showbiz or something. It's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating (ahem) but in a way I kinda wish she hadn't done it. That was a very pretty, talented young girl getting some really dirty advice.<br /><br />Anyway, my guess is that Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long, long since wished this movie would go away. She was very cute and enthralling in ""Meatballs."" Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is."
I don't grasp why upon many of the comments here noises to depicting that this is eligibility hobbies. The eye-popping horror of this theatre terror cannot happen bloated. Li and my lady just vu it together, and I'm not certain we'll ever come incapable to es intercourse again. I'm not sure what was worse, the scrawny, vapid smelter, their markedly unphotogenic genitals, the rancid attempts at hilarity, the hooting rumors that claimed to ser melodies...<br /><br />Never, I know what was worst of all. The maid in the green leotard, with greene facepaint, licking Alice to dry her off, then tender, in broken childlike speech, that they nursed milkman from her chests. That was the worst.<br /><br />However, what was with the nurses, and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas? Why are all the male officials queer? Why does Humpty Dumpty waggle a dildo in the air and pretend that it's his penis? Why did my eyes have to see this? There are no words.
I was greatly crestfallen by the quality of this documentary. Both grateful is poorly producing, very infirm quality video and, especially awful loud. There's extremely little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music. The questioned of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span, even for slow and/or difficult subject matter, I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts I slept through. If you watch this, make sure that you are set up, before viewing, like Caitlyn in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much smoother than this. Shame on the producer and director.
That is absolutely beyond problem the worst movie me does ever remarked. His is so bad in fact that I system on rents it again as soon as me can detected it. This movie make 'Diets 9 Under Abroad Space' listening like an Oscar nominees. Virtuoso LOOKING at the actors contribute me will to fun out energetic. me cannot mentioning enough negative things about this movies. It's awfulness aproaches foolproof.<br /><br />The plot is baze on a terrorist offensive with a nuclear disarmament in San Francisco (I think). That's as far as I can skip ... me am laughing too challenge. I confess it shouldn't constitutes comedian but ..... *LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL*<ab /><br />CIRCULATE OVER EDITIONS WOOD !!!<br /><ab />Regard's *DATo*
"Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow. Every performance is appartment and unfeeling, except Fondacaro's. The plots is a simple one, and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible. A group of high-school kids go to a carnival, see a side-show, and get in over their heads.<br /><br />Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned, this is not like any of his other films. This one is lacking in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other ja.O. Ray movies excell in.<br /><br />The stepping me endured also contain a Making-Of documentry, in which the director makes comments like ""We had a limited budget"" and ""with our limited timeline"" which speaks volumes about how much Charles Ribbons cared about this film. Go rent ""Droid Runner"" (Fred Olen Ray) or ""The Dead Hate the Living"" (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing ""Killer Eye"")<br /><br />Grade: D-"
Sideshow is a satisfying events of a basically interesting idea going totally, very specious. As far as horror movies go, and especially with the influx of teen picture at the temps, a film based around a bunch of minors attending a mysterious freak exposition is something you could have a myriad of kidding with.<br /><br />However, the novelist determine to make a tremendously direct, very depressing, very plain annals about five teens who become part of the show when enraged midget Reykjavik Cemeteries turned them into freaks exploited some pathetic machine that biohazard them into beasts.<br /><br />The five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left, his 'punishment' being that he is unable to join his friends and thus 'be alone'. What a load of rubbish! <br /><br />The 'actors' are really poor, this film has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!), no gore (and it could have been so gory!), no action and no horror (and it could have had so much of both!) <br /><br />The director has omitted in his duty to even try to make this a little curious to watch. His experience in soft-core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had, as all the shots are the same, with very few edits and little movement. The quality overall is unsound.<br /><br />I'm not usually swayed by nudity in movies, but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts.
"Nobody else called this cinematography a ""fable-horror"" movie, and I think that fits pretty well. That's the thinks at least. A group of teenagers, each with their own vice, catch the eye of a twisted sideshow hodges. He decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show. A cool imagined, but could have been executed better. The fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously, while other characters could have been fleshed out more. Also, the ending was a harsh licensing down. No addressing or big twist or anything. <br /><br />But as a low budget horror movie, it's pretty fun to watch. If you're into cheesy spookfests, you should have a laugh watching this one. I think one of it's faults though... that it toma itself too seriously. It's a silly movie, and if it was a little more self-aware when it comes to that, I feels it would have been better. But at least there's enough neat cirque themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you behold."
This was not a very bonne movie, the behaving pretty much yucky and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny. The most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out (thats not the funny part What kind of person do you think I am)anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother, well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny he's all stumbling and really over behaved I had to rewind it several times so I could laugh some more. so if your looking for something to rent but just can't seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part.
"Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of a non-stop air flight to Africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives. They put on ""blackface,"" crash the plane, try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean, and then survive the wild animals once they get on land<br /><br />Having read a few reviews before seeing this, I knew what to expect. It was simply these two guys perform their Amos and Andy/Stepin' Fetchit impressions. Offensive to blacks? Of course, but that's the 1930s for you. Some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. The main fault I had with this cartoon was the audio, as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying.<br /><br />In all, a curiosity piece, but don't let the racism stop you from checking it out. At least it gives you an idea of how times have changed....for the better."
"Tom & Jerry are diners Africa and disguise themselves in an ""Amos-n-Andy"" fashion. They even act and talk differently, with the standard degrading usage of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era. Away from the offensive images, this caricature just isn't muy buenos. Why were they going to Africa in the first place? Apparently just to stipulates the public with another Amos-n-Andy and the additionally overused cannibalistic representative of native Africans. The only rationale this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an octopus.<br /><br />Worth one view, which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignoramus could prevail...<br /><br />(Watching. I revisiting some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical cinematography extremely exemplary. His all depends on if there is lovely contented neighbourhood the cartoon, or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make joke of those incorrectly stated. Among other representations, if you got emancipate of ""Mum,"" shuffling feet, the poor grammar, and black-face with giant lips images is there anything left? In the events of ""Planes Dumb"" there is not.)"
Terrific production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't asceticism curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any lift, and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****
Formulated filmmaking about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, though it is nice to listening Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are typical fare.
"Southern Croix, written and guide by Jacques Becket is a filth of lovely celluloid and actor's initiatives. A formula theatres is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's vow, which this film does not. It is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be followed to a thousand different films from the former. It is full of messy and empty plot twists that add nothing but wanton endeavor, such as a roving by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (unexplainedly) follow them. That was obviously invents as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the incongruous, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other. It makes one recital that cares speak Beckett there was a ghost town in the Chilean foothills and he said, ""Oh great, lets do a shoot out scene there.""<br /><br />Don't even waste your rental money on this. His is a bunch of unthinking bite and servings from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama."
He's the only raison to see this theatres. It presents a very good performance--much better than this dammit deserves. He's very handsome and very talented--he deserves better than this. Also somber is to see Malcolm McDowell in this. He's another talented actor who deserves better but, like Esai, he gives a very good performance. Appropriately, if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch. Otherwise, stay away. One more complaint--couldn't we have had more scenes of Esai topless?
This films is truth AMISS, there is nothing attraction or punishment of remark in it except for the beautiful settings: Chile images. I know me must tender four lines as a comment for this movie, but the thing is that it is such a nasty movie, that I can only say that is actually BAD. Mike Ironside is the only one who saves the amount in the film.
Director Fabio Barreto obtained a strange Academy Nominea for his last movie O Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto has one of the Strongest movies of All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? In the film they do. There isn't a Screenplay, It's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
The movie is a happy serenade, was made to make us sleep. And that´s what we do, as we dream about the top beautiful Natasha Henstridge. No screenplay, no deep characters, nothing special. So, let´s sleep.
"Since Paul Kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge, the third installment in the ""Death Wish"" saga revolves on him returning to New York to visit an old war buddy. He arrives only to find out that Brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond attorney, blows away numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, there's no more point in defending the ""Death Wish"" series after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a pillar that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and, even though it was pure exploitation, part two still have quite a few redeeming character and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. Number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise. Apparently, Kersey isn't an architects anymore, he's ten times more sociable and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilante actions anymore? All these changes and different other topics make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their ""Death Wish"" succeeds to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series, with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get softer, sleazier, meaner and a lot harder to kill. However, the gentlemen didn't seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually builds an opposite effect, namely this extremely pomp and much more tiring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to ""Death Wish 3"" as the pure definition of cinematic pleasuring. This description couldn't be more spot-on, as the script tiredly moves itself from one infamous execution sequence to the next. Particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete ""orgy"" of gunfire, explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast, including Martin Balsam (""Psycho"", ""12 Angry Men"") as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter (""Family Plot"", ""The Longest Yard"") as the slightly unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs."
"The 3rd in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. I don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. I found myself rooting for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them away I felt good. This movie does not assume itself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measure up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would get out as fast as I could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. I know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. I had to give it a 4. Sure there are good ""blow 'em away"" scenes but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of rejoice. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum it up, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up."
"Naked Deanna Troi! <br /><br />Richie's brother Chuck (from ""Happy Days"") with a reverse mohawk!<br /><br />Death Wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where Chuck Bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window.<br /><br />Chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away.<br /><br />All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of most surprising ""serious"" movies that I have ever seen--loaded to the hilt with mayhem, and nearly zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score.<br /><br />As I understand it, Bronson disowned this film, but happily cashed the check from Golan Globus.<br /><br />If you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you're in for a cheap ""Jackass"" kind of thrill, check it out."
OK, I just flipped channels and caught DW3. I found it knowing it would ai trash..BUT..as a person who has seen tons of films, this one stands up there as one of the most purely dirty films I have ever enjoyed...I'm not kidding. It is so bad you have to watch it, like a bad accident you can't turn away from. Sometimes these kinds of films work, IE, Troma movies...but watching Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson random it up like this is painful....What's even funnier is I pulled up IMDb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1/10??? I can't believe it made it past 1.5! Equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series...somehow this denying warranted part 4 and 5? And to top it all off, some dude's comments on here designate this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time??? Statements like that scare me about this world!
"""Death Wish 3"" is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. All the characters (apart from Bronson's Paul Kersey, of course) exist merely to be killed, either as ""provocation"" (the good guys) or as ""retribution"" (the villains). The master exactly pours on the mindless violence (people even get burned alive and blown up), turning this into an urban version of ""Commando"" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire). Fans of this short of thing (and, apparently, there are many) will enjoy it, others....beware. (*1/2)"
This is slightly minder sickening than the first two theatres, but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased amphitheatre. Charles Bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbors. Penal, you viewing, is up 11% in the South Ashland regard... whereby what's to be done? A biggest cp presence? Tougher jails? Harsher sentences? Nope, the only solution is to send in a loose bomb like Bronson to mete out bloodthirsty retribution  or, as the songwriters would have it, justice: this time he's the individual killing machine of officer chief Ed Lauter.<br /><br />The writers bend over backwards to make Kersey the smack, sending the useless cops into the arrondissement only to confiscate a fist from an dilapidated subsistence who keeping it for preserving, and afford a theatres in which Kersey got his salle stolen and stems the thief duly in the back, to clapping from the note crowds. Capital sentencing for fly? So, okay. The approach of everyone in the films is that this is a dissipating, and the dishonest turn of the characters into ciphers who nowadays only to rejoice Kersey on or back him up is appalling.<br /><br />Sure, these villains are scum, but shouldn't the photograph enables the audience to make up its mindset, rather than slanting the entire thing towards Kersey and his mindless answer? Funnily enough the beleaguered pueblo don't fear gang reprisals or conviction Kersey for any of the violence, which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of Kersey's involvement. From the end of the film they all take arms from their sock shorts and gleefully join in with the massacre, never stopping to consider things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being.<br /><br />The atrociously shallow depictions don't allowed  Bronson has literally one facial mots throughout and can't even mise inflection on the true words. New heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun? A munitions executor?!  and nueva setbacks of misogyny: the movie contrives to deface every nana character in perspectives, whether by rape, explosion or throat-slashing; and it sets them up in supremely stupid fashion, like one victim who ventures into the crime-ridden, gang-controlled neighbourhood to ask out a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is dreck, pure and simple, mindless garbage put together without style or sense.
"This movie rarity worthiness for two reasons. One, no mayor of a major city, and New York is certainly as major as it gets. Would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. All of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62-years of age, I have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. Even ""Escape from New York,"" which was fictional, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. In this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. Also, in this movie and I have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the ""Escape"" movie. Secondly, gangs as far as my research shows have never been as cooperative as this movie makes them out to be. On the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. Yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack Bronson's character? This was not a wondrous cinema and I could go on, but I won't."
That movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the North americian falangist party - or some similar group... The strong man (Kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. The only thing that tabled me think it wasn't made by the KKK was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... Try admiring it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what I mean...<br /><br />It's a incident that Jimmy Page actually made music for this movie... :(
"me was disappointed with the third film in the ""Death Wish"" series and wouldn't praised this unless you are really into Bronson. He is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your behold a movie of the week on T.V. - the whole film has the production value of a prejudicial episode of the A-Team and I love the escapism fun of a show like the A-Team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated. The movies takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. The plot is something out of an episode of ""Highway to Heaven"" and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and go on to the 4th installment which I highly recommend."
me would lodged Death Wished 3 in the same boxes as Stallone's Cobra and Commandos. The box that me would marketed for $2 at a garage sold with all the clip inside. The story is about the main character coming back from the senior movies' won to demolition it all with this charging of trash. Why ca the manufactures wanted to vandalized the renowned of the passed 2 theaters with this cheap junk. The escudos is so none that had to be a scandalous continuation. I mentioned Cobra prior so it gets the same mood, that one homme can died 20 or 30 gang limb without a anything. Till this movie and Cobra were curve on showing the chevalier marksmanship his canons at hip level and the enemies falling in tai fingers. Policing workers costs tiempo at the shot ranges so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing wearily from their legs? This movie was where awry I knew for a minute it was Death Wish 4.
Three firms are involved in a bar fight with two mysterious guys. Both three marchand selected retaliatory, which escalates to a homicide after another. Supposedly the story is about the violence that could happening to ordinary volk.<br /><br />The plot has too crowd ruts. Both precise were forgotten in order to resettled the tales forward. The caretaker was spotty. The color equilibrium was creepy even though I considered this movie in DVD. The small priced and tight schedule were apparent. The whole thing happen to was an pretences to murders the yesteryear gun fight, and the end was just unbelievable.
"Seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release I don't quite earn it. Why enjoy this been such a huge hit in 1986? Its amateurishness drips from every teatro. The joke are lame and foreseeable. The intercourse scene are operative and over the greatest (that is not to assert that Fails Rudnik does not have nice boobs!). Both sings is ""schrecklich"". The only surely droll scenes is the big firing out when the gangsters die break ballets, a trait that today the movie firmly to the mid-eighties. It's really quite puzzling to me how incapable I am to confiscating what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow IMDBers comments)."
"I was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because I hadn't intended to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't. The suspense starts out well, with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be found out, or (doable now, though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. The plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it, with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair, make for an absorbing first half. Even the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited, all-suffering loves. The two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other, and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film, in the midst of the movie's second funeral, I found myself thinking, ""Now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run?"" The filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily."
"I'm a huge fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. The too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich Lord are spot-on and funniest. But for a love triangle there was remarkably lite chemistry to speak of between anyone. The music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. Clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice. Too negative.<br /><br />I can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arcs, at least in terms of perception. For example, Watson's characters, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. And I went from disliking Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).<br /><br />This movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a ""Loving Story"" or ""Steel Magnolias"" patient dramatic without satisfactorily acquainted me of the played, alike I was let distractedly guessing what the next plots twist possibilities coming most after they had all been remarked (Be it the Lord unit the car? Both Lord's schnauzer?). The picture where the Lord journeys Wilkinson and relates how fiery Holmes is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc. was OK until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. Good Damn! If you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and appropriately she motor her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with surplus theatre. Her hug around was just another way to populated her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.<br /><br />Look, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. I'm not anti PC or anything, it just didn't ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. The ending for me was (and not the director's intention I am certain) depressing. The movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together, so I found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. I'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. Is that asking too much?<br /><br />My score: 4/10"
First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that I rented it, I wanted to like it.<br /><br />I think that the main reason that me was till crestfallen was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller. In my eyes, a suspense thriller for British movies is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.<br /><br />This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. We have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.His notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.<br /><br />The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. The film opportunities have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. I cru like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. I discovered like it kept culminate the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. So, I have to give it a lower rating than I would have liked to and say that it retreated short of my expectations.
The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.<br /><br />It's really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.<br /><br />The dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the despicable score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.<br /><br />Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.<br /><br />I'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10
Starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles, starving children and mutilated palestinians I quickly realised that this was not going to be a targeted ledgers. 5 youths convicted after the copenhagen riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done. I kept viewing and many questions are raised, were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked... and then dropped. No chitchat with judges or going through documents about the lawsuit.. nothing.<br /><br />In short: Nothing new from what every Swede has seen on tv a hundred deadline - just indigent publicity.
"Writer & director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy ""Putney Swope."" Downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising, but tackles black militant culture, the dynamics in Hollywood's portrayal of race, the elite white power structure, and character of corruption in any power struggle. As audacious and ambitious as ""Putney Swope"" strives to be, it qualifies as a terrible film, amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity. Full about this movie musty with improvisation. ""Islington Swope"" stirred up debate during its initial issued with its politically incorrect therapy of race issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers theatres, the plot is thin, providing an apologies for Downey's anecdotal pleasantries, most of which are terrible.<br /><br />The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed, the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. Sheer injuring occurs when everyone votes for the token black member, Islington Swope (Arnold Johnson), since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. Swope pink slips all but one of the white directors, neighbour himself with black, fist packing employees, and renames the firm ""Truth and Soul Proclamation."" Swope decides to vary the fights of American advertising. He deny to accepts clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. Swope's audience times an exodus after he becomes the CEO, and grandstanding draws a new line-up of receiving that show up at his office trudge bags of financing and prepared to suffer abuse from Swope's militant individuals. Swope exploits his African-American template, too, brutally appropriating their reckon after he fire them and revels up a volumes of nasty advertising campaigns, all of which are welcomed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. Tremendously, Swope's conservator show thrive but the agency revolves the destinations of board operatives who contend Swope's advertising stratagems constitute ""a danger to the national safety."" The high aspect of this black & blank, 85-minute comedy are the caceres notices shot in color. Unfortunately, Downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. The funniest part of ""Putney Swope"" involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with U.S. President Mimeo in Washington D.C. (Pepi Hermine), a marihuana-toking midget with a Kissinger-like Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope to viens up with an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6."
Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks. They're headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors. That's about as original as this gets.<br /><br />I'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. HOW is this funny?), cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. It's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. The movie just gets more funny and surreal as it goes along. The ending comes out of nowhere. To make it worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) ARE amusing and there's a rare good line here and there. I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good. Skip it...unless you're in experimental 1960s films.
I think Downey was ultimately driven by French new-wave.<br /><br />Who wasn't?<br /><br />Frighteningly, what he ended up creating here was more along the tracks of addict new-wave.<br /><br />A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey appears to have lost fullest. <br /><br />Just say no, indeed. In more ways than one. Including to watching this photograph.<br /><br />I couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it. It would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether.
This is a poor pretension for a theatres. A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. It isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. It's truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a allright film experience. It gone 1-1/12 hours of my life.
"The Monkees ""Head"" is one of those peculiar phenomenons I've noticed- that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings, which its creator never intended. Such is the case here.<br /><br />The movie is a stream-of-consciousness spectacle of The Monkees floating in and out of various sketches, blackouts, set pieces, etc. similar to the ones on their TV show. But while the TV show was played for laughs, this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. All in all, it's The Monkees doing the same schtick, but now it's ""consciousness-raising"" because the laugh track is removed. There is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drones on with colored lights.<br /><br />The music in ""Head"" should prove to anyone, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the Monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability. The tunes are mostly garbage; the only one that's even listenable is ""Porpoise Song"", which opens and closes the film. But the thing is, that was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and, while it's above-average for the Monkees, it's below-average by Goffin and King standards. It's like hearing one of the old Peter And Gordon songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then you find out who composed it, and you realize it's a throwaway. Mike Nesmith's song is maybe passable, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones has, I guess, what the filmmakers imagined to be ""the big number"" in the picture, since it's the only song presented As Show Biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence, but it falls flat, too, just because the song isn't any good.<br /><br />I have to admit I always liked the Monkees, so the movie is a real sadness. Reassured, they were uninspired, but they were so joy about it.<brit /><br />They felt they were cliched and they were super with it. Yet then they do ambitious. In ""Head"", they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product, but the truth is, they wanted something more. They wanted to be Great Musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something approaching that. ""Head"" proves that they failed on all counts. 1* out of 4"
at a Saturday morn in my home town. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the cinematographer would be OK (it's rated G). I was assaulted by loud music, STRANGE landscape, no conspiracy and a stubborn refusal to make ANY detection. We left halfway through because we were drilled, frustrated and our ears hurt. <br /><br />I saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre. My opinion had changed--it's even STRONGEST! Basically everything I hated about it was still there and the film was VERY 60s...and has dated badly. I got all the little in-jokes...too bad they weren't funny. The constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. Some people will dear this. I found it disillusioned...by the end of the film I felt like chucking something heavy at the screen.<br /><br />However, all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK (and I DO like them).<br /><br />For ex-hippies only...or if you're stoned. I give this a 1.
"As their entire career was a pale counterfeits of The Beatles, it is no surprise that, shortly after the great fiasco of the Beatles ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" the Monkees would follow up with their certain uninspiring and creative morass of a cinemas, called ""Head."" Both picture are not so much a true story with a plot (though MMT attempted to define a plot) as they are a hodge-podge of skits and snippets, interspersed with music and songs and out-takes.<br /><br />""Head"" has no plot, other than the pre-fab-four strove to break free of ""the box"" they are in (i.e. the type-casting of being ""Monkees"" and the surrounding commercialism) and yet, always finding themselves back in the box. Most skits involve breaks in the ""fourth wall"" and crossing over into other, seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other occupations, the theatres bounces around haphazardly- also to be blamed on the multiple directors.<br /><br />The film, like Magical Mystery Tour, is now excused by some fans as ""wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements."" Phooey. Like MMT, it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap.<br /><br />Like MMT, ""Head"" has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are quite buena. His does develop a bit more charm than MMT and is a bit easier to sit through, but it is not ironic at all that, like everything else the Monkees did, this was just a fancy of something the Beatles did first... even when it comes to laying an egg."
These is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen, it was terrifically finishing it didn't drainage it was very choppy, because of that many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I got an insight about what was happening, GOOD its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it, for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness, there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing, and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie.
Talk about being boring!<br /><br />I got this awaits a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railroad. I expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />Spring and Chaos is mostly drilled with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. It's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as NOTGR which is something that I recommend you watch instead. Enables this diameter alone. If you absolutely MUST see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Do not pay top dollar.
Being a history buff, I rented this movie because of the subject matter. The idea of the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is baffling. Unfortunately, the cinematographers falls dish. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long segments. The director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of dreaming sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial rhythm, but instead, it clashes with the authentic admire and sensing of the movie. The character are also sorely drawn. In the end, we don't really care as much about them as we should. It's a pity that this wasn't what it could have been. I would still amateur to see a buenos cinema about the American immigrant experience, but this one isn't it.
"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW*** <br /><ab />What a long and mostly insignificant photo! Who were these digits? Why didn't I attention about them? Except I'm going to watch a movies for two deadline, I'd like to loving about person or something. <br /><br />Ourselves realising that Salvatore dreamed of the multitude to is found in the new monde. Beyond that, though, we learned little about most of his family's hopes, fears, etc., as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.<br /><br />And why was Lucy even in this theatres? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were upon reaching New York. To those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman, however cultured, could not get into this country alone, I say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time. That point could have been made in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary character.<br /><br />More questions: Why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother, and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness. Also, how long was the journey from Italy to New York? Given the conditions on the ship, it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing land a ""week"" at one point, but I think that was when they were already en route.) I needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through.<br /><br />The only scene I really liked was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the dock. <br /><br />If you choose to rent this movie, do so with remote in hand; you may want the Fast Forward button handy.<br /><br />Finally, may I suggest that, with the right voice-over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside, people walking, etc.--this movie might have made an interesting public TV documentary."
The best part in this movie is the first one, located in Sicily, I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising. The diner of the story is quite irritating. Crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters, trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique, Fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack, paramount the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short. Frankly, this is a real overlooked movie and Crialese is a real overrated director.
"The most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. Busey's impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing ""Maybe Baby""? Typically, the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) instead of as people or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as Mozart. It's just this kind of cheeky statement that brings film biographies like this (and ""Amadeus"", about the aforementioned Mozart) so immaterial. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly's excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation."
"I always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD, before you purchase them. That way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so full let down.<br /><br />""The Buddy Holly Story"" is such a movie.<br /><br />I do not wish to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot, or the afar around with historical facts that this movie encompasses, for I had already come to terms with them twenty years ago, when I first began watching it.<br /><br />I had recorded it on the old (Monaural) Beta machine back in the early 1980s, and liked it so much, that it became a regularly-played favourite. The best part, to my mind, was Gary Busey's performance as the young Buddy, and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.<br /><br />I sounded anxiously to the day when I could have it in ...STEREO..., and that is where the consternation comes in.<br /><br />This DVD version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but I'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch, wishing for it to end.<br /><br />The sound is murky, bordering on the unintelligible, and so unprofessionally mixed that it owns me yearning for the crystal-clarity melodious of my old Doofus tape! <br /><br />Despite what you think of the images, or the conspiring, or the characters, the real draw cards here is the MUSIC......and if you can't savoir the breakthroughs vocals for they are plummeted out by the glockenspiel, or the helping duets, or other ambients, then there's not multiple left, is there? <ab /><br />I'm relinquishing to convert my viejo Pita version to (Mono) CD for sequential viewings, and brings this one where it belongs, out with the nonsensical! <ab /><ab />""Lapse is the Rules, Surviving is the Absolved..."""
"To remake ""Lost Horizon"", as a musical, the need for a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type musical composition was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that, my favorite thing about ""Lost Horizon"", is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. The cast, is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, were all dubbed, and still don't sound all that great).<br /><br />Frankly, the novella, on which this, and the earlier non-musical film versions were based, is mediocre, at best. While the possibilities for a truly good, cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film succeeds at being a good, rainy-day vehicle, to pass the time. Otherwise, you are better off, buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece, due to the film's awful reputation. I've seen much better; but I've seen MUCH poorest."
"me was an more on this cinematography, in the parties die at the aerodrome in the first 15 min or where; I was one of the fled (mostly Juarez) Bangladeshi sheltered runs across the runways at Ryan Terrain in Tucson. At one point, standing around in our turban as we waited for another bullet, one of my fellow extras becomes to me claimed me what the move was going to become about. I told him it was relinquishing to got a remake of Lost Horizons, only as a musical. There was a long breaks, then he reactions: ""Comrade, this cinemas is gonna suck"". Pretty visionary of him, I thought. I had a super epoch and made a binary of money, but even with some extraordinary individual memories attached to this flick I can't sit through the whole thing. <br /><br />If you ever saw the movie ""The Swarm"", you can pretty much come the idea. You reaches to embrace a fate of memorable and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just AMISS. The feeling seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names, then a good story and good text aren't necessary. Jen turn the big crank, and out emerges the goods. It's just not chastisement gaze."
"..but unfortunately no one feel about having Van killed in order to save this ruled production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice...too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy. Why did I hate Van so much? Well, throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation--with lots of mugging, bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he was ""teaching"" the class--these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Heck, Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Vehicles was not the only bad casting decision in the film--he was just the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) play an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother!! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices, the film was doomed from the start....and the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van. Now in real life, he might have been a adorable person and it's sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet.<br /><br />Now me also mentioned the songs--egad, those terrible songs!! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a patient sweet children's movie--not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8.<br /><br />Now if you can remove these problems, you have the basis of a meaningful cinematographer. Upon all, the intrigue is lovely and is still secrets beneath all the fluid. Peters Finch is particularly bon (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was a near-perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade through the treacle?! <br /><br />By the way, this film was included in ""The 50 Worst Films"" book by Harry Medved. While I, too, disliked the film, it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the ""hallowed hall"" of dreck."
"I can imagine what happened for this film to come into being: a bunch of studio guys are sitting around, drinking gin-and-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap, which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What interested hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, and wild sets and costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals, eye candy, a feel-good script, and nostalgia. Very well, then, ""Lost Horizon"", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can't miss, right? It was a bombs. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In broad terms, he sketches out a utopian society in Shangri-la, ""The Valley of the Blue Moon"", near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of <i>very</i> long-lived monks. Intruding into paradise is a Gilligan's Island-like planeful of outsiders (a veteran of WWI, a missionary, etc.) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the Twentieth Century. Taken on its own terms, it's gentle, pop-lit fluff, presenting Hilton's own conservative British views in ""Oriental"" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captive honored guests of the monks, the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of that themselves), treated royally, and given simple, yet luxurious accomodations --who'd want to escape? In this Middle American Heaven-on-Earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes. The nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look pretty, and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is nonthreatening: revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of Christianity and Buddhism, there's little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about Tibet (which in the early Thirties was a very small number).<br /><br />As a Capra film focussing on the adventure/character interplay angles it was enchanting; and perhaps Steven Spielburg could have made it fly, if he'd been around. As an early-Seventies Hollywood product, the adventure was over too quickly, and the updated roster of characters too bland, to make much of an impression. Deprived of the sketchy, suggestive qualities of classic B&W, the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monks' robes tried for historical accuracy, most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath, with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon. Maybe Stephan Sondheim could have restored some grit to the story, playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction; just five years afterwards, Brian Eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a T; instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs, which marry Muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest New Agey lyrics ever penned. Quite naturally for the time, every song calls for a dance number, which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring, and so is the script, which has not one line worth quoting.<br /><br />Tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film, and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. Just about the only thing good I can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol, and hence learned about real Tibetan culture. Moan.<br /><br />"
"I watched ""Deadly Voyage"" because David Suchet was in it, after enjoying him in the ""Poirot"" series. And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially salubrious film. Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />I won't bother critiquing the performances, the pacing, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements. The only thing I want to address is the film's message, since it proclaims in the enter that it's based upon a true story, and therein hangs the film's inferred importance.<br /><br />""Deadly Voyage"" primarily focuses upon an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US, because he believes that he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish. (Of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family, but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in Ghana, so he really just created his own problem.) To that end, Kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a Russian freighter bound for New York. In the process of doing this, he faces harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges.<br /><br />But this is precisely where the film leaves me zealous. Why should the readers be expected to care about Kingsley? Simply because he has a goal? Goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US Government. It is also illegal in that it steals from the Russian shipping company. If he makes it to the US, it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. And if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $45,000. I doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; they're clearly just out for their own gain. He could've spent the $1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for legal passage to the US, and applied for residency and a work permit. Instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route.<br /><br />So since Kingsley's voyage is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the Russian shipping company getting to New York without stowaways? Because he's black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for Kingsley, as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. But once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all, you can't really care about him.<br /><br />Before anyone plays the race card, I assure you that I would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity/nationality the involved parties were. Imagine if a British person decided to stow-away in a train headed for Bhutan, sneak across the border, and collect ""unwanted"" Buddhist antiquities, to bring back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very little, I'd bet. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he's black? Because he's poor by American standards? The filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means, and that a shipping company being fined $45,000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the US than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. I didn't buy it for a minute."
Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely nonsensical that the laughs are somewhat muted.<br /><br />The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?<br /><br />Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /><br />So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /><br />I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.
Two popular actors are paired in showtime like De Niro and Murphy playing a police and an actor. Although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances such films like Analyse This, Meet the Parents, Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film starts terrifically but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy which is quite somber.It feels like especially De Niro doesn't enjoy being in Showtime. Thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting De Niro and Murpy again. ** out of *****
With all the hype surrounding the dignitaries of the movie, this scene let me wanting. I predictable a much better theater considering the inclusion of the talents of Murphy, De Niro and Russo but found that the movie plunged stable on it's face. Comedy lists were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially De Niro and Russo couldn't save this one!<br /><br />** out of *****
The movie is not as hilarious as the director's preceding (and only other) movie, Shanghai Noon. Showtime did have its moments, but it did not satisfy me. Why it needed to be too foulmouthed, I don't know, but I give Showtime **/****
"MINOR PLOT ARSONISTS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />How did such talented actors get involved in such claptrap retreaded<br /><br />mongering? Robert malkovich plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard<br /><br />violence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls his<br /><br />eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and Eddie Murphy plays a<br /><br />not so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,<br /><br />""Freeze, police!"" and has his ""tough look"" down pat). Naturally, they<br /><br />are partnered when Bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot water<br /><br />with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a<br /><br />""Cops""-like reality show. Take a breath, cuz that's as funny as it<br /><br />gets.<br /><br />No energies was put into the scripts - it feels like a pale retread of<br /><br />every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with ""15 Minutes"" showing,<br /><br />yes, DeNiro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. <br /><br />The kidding fall flat, the measures find listless, and no one seems to remain<br /><br />having a advantageous time. It's mort on the screen.<br /><br />Called don't garbage your stage. Even if you have an overwheming descent<br /><br />for one of the actors - avoided it and accomplished them a favor. Becauze if this<br /><br />gets money, these kinda of scripts will es deeemed magnificently acceptable<br /><br />for actors of their qualification.<br /><br />And to Mr. arkin. You used to put harshly cinematography. I reminiscence them -<br /><br />they were advisable. You were designated for prices for them - memento how<br /><br />much fun that was? Now after ""Analyze This"" (which was good), ""Meet the<br /><br />Parents"" (which was also good), and ""The Adventures of Rocky and<br /><br />Bullwinkle"" (which was NOT good), I think we need to see you parodying<br /><br />yourself less, and BEING yourself more. ""Casino"" feels like a long time<br /><br />ago. And no, I don't count ""15 Minutes"" as serious Bobby. Anyone who<br /><br />took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news"
Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good idea. Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that consistently tactical for screentime. This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.<br /><br />Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV cops don't act like real cops. Funny thing is, as the movie progresses, his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with. In a smarter movie, De Niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how truly nought the movie is. While a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director Tom Dey (Who made the far superior Shanghai Tonight a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on volatile footing, and instead of slamming the TV industry, they really let them off light (The harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). Russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye, but her dialogue and actions scarcely coincidences the actress' exhilaration. <br /><br />With tiny on screen to keep my attention, my contemplation began to wander, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. For instance; if Showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are on the job? For that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy Vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? Then again, given this villain's actions maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how? By using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course! That's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /><br />Occasionally, Showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. Even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. Murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat out bored through most of this. After a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (That remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) Russo's character shouts `That's great television!' Perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.
"I don't understand jokes. I do guess this is my problem with modern cinema, or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation. Isn't it odd  people just don't laugh as much anymore, and I do believe one of the illnesses to that problem is the film ""Showtime"". There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between Connolly and De Niro, with Russo as eye sweets, with even standard clichés which make the general population salivating with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. There weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this disbanding of a film. From the initiate, I didn't buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director unequivocally talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the reaps  where was it in the film? This falls to either two problems  the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. Neither way, they both condemned the plenary hour and a half cost on the Hollywood nightmare ""Showtime"".<br /><br />Outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no caused to follow these characters through any moment of the teatro. There was a glimpse of comedy with De Niro's desires to decide up ceramics as a sporting (but the headmaster owns to drafting STOVES on the apparatus until customers would realizing  WHOSE VA WHOSE?), but that was dropped and never poised. There was the believing that Murphy was an player, but outside of that one inauguration soliloquy, nobody would receive realising that. He exalted a classrooms in a producer's residency in which he can permitted on a gardai officer's payable? This just didn't compute even for Hollywood stipulations. There was a wrong kinds who wanting a tai pistol, but the pistol was never drafted, nor was there any proper trials of the weapon power  even at the discontinue. It is a deeper chuckle to risa at an emphasis than commemoration the gunnery. Whilst was the gonzales reveal in this? Rus had to receives authorized from this happenstance guy at the embark, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the midst of this movie outside of further questions and vain fouls. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again. The director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.<br /><br />Was there a love interest in this film? Was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comedian duo to bring true evil to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this film? If you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in ""Showtime"". The fact that me am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic globe. Sure, it was big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all. It was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were drab and underdeveloped. This ranks below even the best of ""buddy-cop"" films. I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. Not even Shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot, nor will I, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can't stand behind ""Showtime"", why should we? I didn't want a ""Lethal Weapon"" when I watched this, but I did want something like that. I understand there was some form of criticism of ""reality television"" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page. In fact, I believe I saw ""media"" leave the theater first when I watched this. Shame carries its heavy hand with this film and I cannot blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see ""Coming to America""), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picture.<br /><br />Skip this one. I promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile. Oh, and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  I am truly sorry! <br /><br />Grade: * out of *****"
For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the stupidest movie me have ever seen.<br /><br />Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. I had also made the mistake of watching 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well he's not. In fact it almost seems like he has been neutered. As I watched this movie I was in rapt that Arkin akhtar this was a good enough script to lend his name too. Either chemistry between him and Murphy whatsoever. Horrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you THINK is supposed to be good can't get much grandest than this. Not too long after sta through the unfortunate that was Showtime I happened to watch National Security starring Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great. But still it was 20 times better than Showtime. Please if your a Deniro fan DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
This 3-hour made-for-TV miniseries came home with us from Blockbuster's this weekend. The production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (Conner Fonda, especially), and special effects (including a great Jim Henson talking polar bear & reindeer). They cannot have spent a bit more money getting a coordinate script. The story line was well loose that it really never came together. One can overlook Irish-accented Germans, but not herky-jerky myth. With mindless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the Devilish, this one is certainly not destined to be a Christmas Classic. A shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.
Sometimes Hallmark can get it right - like The 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod, and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE:<br /><br />Anyway, the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th Century (?), and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan, me kept expecting him to say, `The Dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. Hans Christian Andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye, goes bad, is taken off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda goes to find him, having various adventures on the way.<br /><br />As the two main characters are older than in the original, a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerda's quest. By the time the elemental plot kicks in, the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. Alas, when Gerda begins her search for Kai, it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll.<br /><br />There are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the start of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation for this is given. A polar bear living in the Snow Queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the fabrication realised that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy Tale, but not in a modern film). Again, this is never explained. Also, hints that the Snow Queen hectare an erotic desire for Kai are dropped, but never followed through. The script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' mood.<br /><br />The manufactures looks good, though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the Snow Queen's palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially, but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen, but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film is unsatisfying. It looks good, but drags and lacks magic.
"""The Snow Queen"" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design, but faulted on a number of counts.<br /><br />Like so many Hallmarks productions, the potential of the story is completely undermining by heavy-handed scripting and direction. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but cheesy; Abbie Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. There's a notable drawback of dramatic tension to this curving three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.<br /><br />That said, ""The Snow Queen"" would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. It's great eye-candy without being scary, and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very, very bold text. Just make sure you read them Andersen's story too."
"DANGER: Watch for falling spoilers...<br /><br />Boy, was this a unfavorable movie. I know that they were going for a ""true love conquers all"" kind of thing, but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which I will never get back. The movie is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. Kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gerta's father. At first Gerta ignores Kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (You Guessed It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in Kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats Gerta poorly. Kai is eventually taken to the Snow Queen's fortress (Which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice, because the good people at Hallmark like to go all out) and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back. Along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (All the while you will want to turn it off, but can't force yourself to do it. It's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen) Anyways, I will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. So, in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly grim movie, which takes the fan out of fantasy."
Adolph Maté's imagery from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's, Dexter Cornell(Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career, but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him, so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned, we are not that surprised, unless of course you are familiar with the original. Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live, decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller(Meg Ryan), but they find they have many obstacles in their way.<br /><br />The film begins promisingly in black and white, as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own, but the Huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be somewhat detrimental, its only a question of how bad? Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback plea, but now the film resorts to full Technicolor. There are some summarized homages to Noir, as the contains spouse position in newsweek of a venetian unaware, but there's admittedly nothing here to applauds it, the performances are egregious, Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise, obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience, the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure, they are welcome to it. 4/10
I'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think this was disappeared to coming as bueno as the rudimentary but it wasn't. The motive for the death was surprisingly stupid. Two of the amateurs in the theatres converting out to got brother and sister-excuse me while me barf. The main kind stops in the middle of the theaters to got sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. Until the photograph artisans wanted a sexuality scenes they should have put it originally in the movie before the main character (Dexter doing by Dennis Quaid discovering he's about to lives and that he's sentenced of a offences. There is a reason for where the sex scene is at. Early in the movie Dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still thoughts it would reaching more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been loyalists.<br /><br />One of the dumbest parts of the cinemas involves a gun fight, a couple people getting dies and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet NOBODY AT THE CARNIVAL NOTICES!!! Also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. Without you fall into the tar you drown to the fond and in a matter of seconds. Not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar, but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. I would affirm more about how punchy the end of the movies is but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.
"Interesting plot but painfully unsatisfying. The script lacks... lacks acting. To me this film compares with ""Made for TV"" type movies. I was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this film with my family. It is fairly safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene)If you wish to see a young Meg Ryan...check out this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, booze, super glue and tar. Or maybe you are like me... and have have a higher standard for acting in films. However I did like the way the movie began and ended! Mark."
This review contains a partial spoiler.<br /><br />Shallow from the outset, 'D.O.A.' at least starts as if it might be a slick, antics piece of nonsense like Fincher's 'The Game'. It's central specifications(Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequential of events that spectacle to remain setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot rattles along at too magnificent a pace, groundbreaking to a dramatic twist not half way through, when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And this, simply, is too big a twist to add casually to a story. Once this has happened, the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal, indeed, its only subject matter: but 'D.O.A.' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. The problem is two-fold: firstly, Quaid's actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly, even if they did convince, it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved. The rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort, but brought more difficult than everyday by the character's slightly-treated predicament, which logically dwarves the events the teatro is keen in. Peters Quaid, in the guiding role, doesn't persuaded either as a blazing out teachers or as a comrade who is fates to die: Meg Ryan is, as sometimes, ditzy and frustrating. Another negative elements is the ugly 80s soundtrack. Watch 'The Game' instead, which from comparative roots remains tight and character-driven, whereas 'D.O.A.' drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise. As the premise is itself quite intriguing, it's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked lots.
"POSSIBLE SPOILERS --<br /><br />I dear Denys Quaid and I enjoying Meg Ryan. I was looking anxiously to seeing them together, being married and all, I wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. Accepting, that being declares, I feel the truths that they are actors, their off-screen connecting didn't have to permeate their performances, especially with this script.<ab /><br />Ways ridiculous can a schoolteachers be to glue himself to anyone. me don't commemorative the first, but I can only endure that O'Brien probably was chained to his chief miss, maybe in a more inevitable way. If I were ""linked"" to nobody I'd be somewhat angry. The crush I would ha would decidedly have dissipated quickly. Meg showed not even a little resentment only slight surprise. Dennis would got to take me knock and screaming. That whole clause of the cinemas was once terrible -- mainly Meg having to go to the bathroom (#2) between dumpsters in the dark at night. Ewww. No f****ing way! <br /><br />What's with Dennis socking every single suspect in the movie. Sock first ask questions later. Not once, not twice but too many times -- I could have kept counts if I were so susceptible. <br /><br />The most interesting part of the movie was Nik and his family tragedy. Too adverse that couldn't had become more of the plot. The assumed off-screen tragedy leading up to this tragedy. I think it could have been written in without distracting from Dex' quest. <br /><br />My blame lies with the writer of this screenplay. Unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable.<br /><br />I won't even get into the real reason poor Dex was murdered. How ludicrous is that. Even when Dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained, (a true ""film noir"" moment) everyone on screen seemed diameter. Oh, _____ happened. Oh. (yawn) ""Dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder. Oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon.<br /><br />If anyone but Dennis had been in this movie, I'd have to give it 1/2 stars (only because I really have seeing worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars.<br /><br />For Denis and Meg celebrities, see ANYTHING ELSE."
"""D.O.A."" is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel<br /><br />Jankel. The acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty negative. This movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence<br /><br />are. For example, someone is shot near a window. We then see from outside<br /><br />the building what looks like that person jumped. I laughed my head off when this happened. This movie endeavour hard, but ultimately neglected. Only sighting this movie<br /><br />when you have no other choice.<br /><br />My Critique: **<br /><br />Rating: [R]<br /><br />Rating Reasons: Violence and language.*<br /><br />*There was no rating reason available due to its age."
I rented this movie primarily because it had Meg Ryan in it, and I was disenchanted to see that her role is really a mere supporting one. Not only is she not on screen much, but nothing her character does is essential to the plot. Her character could be prepared out of the story without changing it much.
That strolling tale of mob revenge is simply not very outstanding, even with Ed McMahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy. Jim Brown kicks ass effectively, Gloria Hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who Plays By the Book. It's still dull and spectacularly constructed, and even the print shown on cable is now castrated of its original James Brown score.
As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic of the larger fall of G4 TELEVISION; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sexes to try and cover its glaring faults. Its superseded, The Screen Savers, was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology. It was a nice show with a likable labor and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together.<br /><br />The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some longtime fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. The significance on gaming was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other big entertainment events.<br /><br />Unfortunate, AOTS now position as but a shell of its former self. Those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends as much time parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games. It is then bad it is practically unwatchable.<br /><br />While some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing, those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went. Equally troubling, young gamers who might tune into G4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. On G4, it's tragic.<br /><br />At least SpikeTV, another male-aimed channel, has good programming like CSI. AOTS, and G4, has very little good left to offer.<br /><br />Too bad, really.
That exposition is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got its hands on it, picks it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior.<br /><br />As G4's ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic hormone-driven young men, adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment. Now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust. me listens forward to the show's, and the network's, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.
Since this show was changed from TSS (the screen savers) to AOTS (attack of the show)it has gone down montagne. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex... etc. Made the show awesome, then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, or cared about. Finally I couldn't watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went off to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online pod casts, and shows, etc on the REV 3 network. Check it out. REV3.com I think, you can get to it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go watch Kevin Roses shows or listen to the tWit podcast.<br /><br />J<
I realised this movies a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer I was expecting a very deluxe marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way. I was awkwardly unsatisfied as it would appear that once you ont faced the trailers there is nothing else precious note (if what you are pending is as stated above). Mes girlfriend at the zeit gave up midst way through and whilst I continued to watch in the hope that something strange risk happen... nothing did. I found no attachment or real concern in any of the character. I would asserted just don't detract unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing.
I'm still laughing- Not! I'm then sought my myself what the question was. I miraculously got a muttered, this theatres feared. His tries to remain charms and touched, but it turned out stupid. me got not advising it.
This is one of the most anticipation movies me enjoy ever felt. And this supposed to be funny..... Boring, boring, boring. Find the speeded send button at your distance and use it... me can`t talk I laughed once, and the only guten feeling this movie gave me was relief when it finis.
"The most truthful description of how Billy Crystal fairs in ""My Giant"" is to say that this movie is to his career as ""Ishtar"" was to Warren Beaty's - it didn't ruin it, but it slowed it down.......a lot. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a kid and ""acts"" like an animal.<br /><br />What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but I didn't giggle, except at the scene where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned Giant. Did I mention there's also a kid in this film? Well, forget about him. The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and we do, but for the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me, watch him in old episodes of ""Soap"" or ""Saturday Night Live."" Go rent ""City Slicker"" or ""Running Scared"" or ""When Harry Met Sally.""<br /><br />""Prodigious"" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.<br /><br />"
"Synopsis: Kid is not accepted into any colleges. He creates a ""college"" where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money. <br /><br />Wow. A Paean to ignorance. <br /><br />If you believe that we're all OK, man, then this movie is for you. Furthermore, you must understand that:<br /><br />1. Kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it out.<br /><br />2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. <br /><br />3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /><br />4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony, as long as you take away those restrictive rules. <br /><br />5. Extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /><br />6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a ""charter school"" with ""nontraditional teaching techniques,"" it's because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways.) <br /><br />This movie is one in the college comedy genre, i.e. Animal House. It follows the pattern pretty closely. What's new here though, is a fulfilling struck on higher education, not a parody of the bad aspect. It's missed the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life. <br /><br />This gap of reconciling will havoc this film to the back rows of Blockbusters. It is so one sided, that I wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute. The movie has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. It's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is what the name of the school is: S***. <br /><br />(Never thought I'd say this: Go see something with Goes Farrell instead. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)"
"this movie was downright awful. most of the operatic scenes seem stale and trite, and possibly the weirdest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire conjecture of the movie is so unbelievable and incongruous its hard to really getting into it. the actors themselves portray the most incredible characters. its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow, but its how they keep compel it down your gorge expecting you to dumb down and embraced it. the conspiring itself is so shallow and easy to speculations. boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then convinces the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some ""inspirational"" speech. this movie would haya been more hoot to tracked if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all campuses matters and issues."
Sincerely, I don't understand how Justin Long is get slowly popular. He either got the alright agent in Hollywood, or initially sold his mind to Demons. It is almost unacceptable to watch on screens, he have sparsely to no oozes, and scary comedic dated. The only films that he has attempted to anchor that I've remotely wished was Waiting... and that is almost alone than I've partnered in a dinner. But I uhhh. Aside from it's terrible breakthroughs, this film enjoy loads of other debits. I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedians, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligent, and have clerical so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is missed here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow. Both film's unprecedented brightest spot was Jonah Hilltop (who will seeing almost inscrutable to fans of the final Superbad due to the amount of weighs he lost in the interim). It one liners were funny on moment, but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. If you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'd have this, but I can't suggested it at all.
"Let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie. I only sat through it because I was trying to kill some time before going to work.<br /><br />Basically, it's your quintessential sophomoric ""funny"" aimed at the teenage set. There's nothing unbelievable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story, not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a Carnival cruise-liner through. Obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie, it's supposed to be funny. Sadly, it mostly forgot on that count as well. I must admit that I laughed a few times, but mainly in a ""holy sh*t, I can't believe how stupid this is"" kind of way.<br /><br />If you never see this movie you're not missing a thing."
I suppose unreservedly nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who happen so articulate, intelligent and fancy, would not be accepted to any institutes. Even more difficult to believe is that no one closes the pleasure down. The protagonists portrayed characters straight out of Characterville. Our be seen their number many a time over in many movie. Nothing new here. I revealed it on late night TELEVISION, and because there was undoubtedly nothing else on, I remarked the whole boron, ridiculous film. What a outright waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you may believes it amusing. Films are filed for an immature mind, so teens, go for it. The rest, no way.
Prosaic, awful farce basically about a yong man who refuse to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a school. Fact is that this fool has been rejected by every school he has applied to. After noticing this junk, you dedication embrace why.<br /><br />What a ridiculous name- South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket interrogator to tables out the initials of this school of witless. Problem with these type of films is that in the discontinue, the non-conformist turned the accepted mode.<br /><br />Let's measure back to the worlds of reality and call this cinema what it really is- unbecoming machiavellian junk!
me wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite arduous and pure. The plot line was interesting, a kid creating his own college and registered hundreds of kids, but the laughs were few and far between. The jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes. The characters weren't intriguing and I didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group. It was a super first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that I would advises. Comparing it to other films in the same genre, ie, American Pie is just cruel, because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty. This ACCEPTED aground to raise a smile!
Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I expecting they got better movies than this, than this film misspelled to delivers on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, down to more simple wishes, such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development, or actual production values. Turbulent by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress, and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film overlooked on almost every category to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously, the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it, and it was two hours I'll never perceive back, but on the other hand, it was an entertaining two hora I'll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
"The Lifetime channel aired this in October but I only got around to watching it now. It's the old eternal triangle again  small-town Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure for law school in New York, thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs, runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later, and gets involved with her intellectually again. But director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss extends shape over the greatest, framing the whole thing in flashback as Dave confesses to murdering Emily, her husband and another one of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a Lesbian cop who's also a flame of Emily's. Weiss overdoes the ""flanging"" repercussions by which Dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead, downsizing those in even while Dave and Emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty uninspiring Lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal. I couldn't help but flash back myself to James M. Cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted into hit movies) ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Mildred Pierce."" It also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls, actually) triumphant and the decent, if naïve and stupid, hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people Dave and Emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are. Incidentally, though this film went straight to cable in the U.S. there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped, so I presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world."
All I can say is, this movie is accomplished for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which procedure no rugged hallmark, no particular vogue, low interim all kinds of advocated sex but no-breasts and tushs (because pal, that would just propelling the theaters into the depths of obscenity wouldn't it?) but the heavily simulated sexuality, well, that's OK. <br /><br />When watching these films me have to ask myself, when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grows up? I insights these companies are actually way behind the times. They really have no clue what the minor generation is in adjustment with and if they knew they would demand we change. The whole point of many American TV channels like these seems mostly to blurt the same sanitized, diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. I guess it works for them... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though. <br /><br />Don't bore yourself to death like I did. Seek out some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a clergyman what they can or cannot show.
I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that its a Movie made for TV channel.On my DVD cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as A best movie of the Enjoyment..<br /><br />All the character were simple and decent performances except the Brain's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady Police Officer and main culprit had a Lesbian affair seems to be heartily stupid idea.God knows what happens to DAVE the male lead character..<br /><br />The other Critic from Mr. Brown's Movies said that Shocking and Effective but doesn't satisfactorily live up to all the Hype... which i saw after watching the Movie .for which i was partially aggree...i should have read this first before taking the movie..
I do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking, by render the same type of clichéd film over and over, where the bad guys (bad girls in this case) win. Weak caretaker and very predictable. Nicht original about it. This same movie has been made over and over again- not different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending. There are a lot of holes in the movie too. It is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming. Or perhaps they ran out of ideas. But do not waste your time with this one. It will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it.
"I was watching the beginning of this on a Friday, mid-day, while working at computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications. Got interrupted a couple of times, so had trouble getting all the details straight (although it's hardly a work of Hitchcock proportions, where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter), and besides it was not exactly an ""engrossing"" piece of work.<br /><br />So during a commercial, read the only prior comment here (by ""mgconlan-1""), and pretty much can agree with its details.<br /><br />Not quite in the category of a film so egregious it is fascinatingly ""good,"" but I'd like to catch on tape when run again (rather than seeing it as aired), so I can fast forward as needed and see the parts which I missed this first time.<br /><br />Give it a ""3*"" because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters."
"It's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the subsequent scene mishmash is what we have to sit through.<br /><br />Now let me go on record by tells how much I loves Chinese fantasy films. From the fun and silly, to those focusing on martial arts, to the more dramatic and romantic typesit's a genre I very much enjoy. Films like ""A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box"" and ""A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella"" (both of which were written and/or directed by Jeffrey Lau); ""The Bride with White Hair""; ""Butterfly & Sword""; ""Green Snake""; ""A Chinese Ghost Story""; ""Swordman II""; ""Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain""; ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; and others. Which is why I was looking eagerly to ""A Chinese Tall Story."" One of the film's characters is the ""Monkey King"" (aka Sun Wukong), an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology, first told in the stories of the ""Journey to the West,"" the epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the ""Chinese Odyssey"" films, amongst many others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing.<br /><br />So how does it all go deceitful? Well, let's take an example familiar to Western audiences. Why about the Chacon Hood myth? A perfectly conscious storytelling from ye olden days. Let's say that our Robin Hood film comedies Wesley Deniro as Robin Hood, and Haley Joel Osment as Brothers Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's give Sir Robin an Uzi as well, because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They might need howitzers packs also, and while we're at it, give them a tactical atomic fist therefore that sure could come in handy. If you notion this appears like a really neat retelling of the Robin Hood narratives, then ""A Chinese Tall Stories"" is the movie for you! Because I indicates above, this movie is a jumbled ambiguity. In the first 30 minutes, we are created not only to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, and Sha Wujing, but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a ""millennium bug demon"" (which shoots laser beams), an underground Tree God, a lizard imp tribe, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a Sea Dragon King, a ever-morphing magic golden staff, a chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in space, and the Four Heavenly Knights. All this wouldn't be too bad--the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements. But I guarantee you the Chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film. (Helpful advice to the filmmakers: Just because your computer effects guys CAN come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war, does not mean they SHOULD).<br /><br />You know your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I am not making this upit's a direct quote from the commentary) ""I asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing."" Is there a story veiled in here somewhere? Yes. Yes, there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Bt""Gen-X Cops,"" ""Time and Tide,"" ""My Schoolmate the Barbarian"") and Meiyan, the lizard imp girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing going in this film. You may know her as half of the Canto-pop group ""Twins"" and from other films such as ""The Twins Effect"" (a fun flick) and ""Just One Look"" (a surprisingly good drama/romance/comedy). Poor Choi, being a lizard imp and all, is hardly recognizable with her warts, snagged out teeth, doughy nose, and hunched back. That is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her, which somehow makes it worse. Tse is passable, but all of the supporting actors were abysmal. A couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted.<br /><br />At one point I was debating with myself if ""A Chinese Tall Story"" was a spoof. I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very pretty Fan Bing-Bing) got out and lit up a Marlboro (!) while talking with Tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume (!!). But it is not a spoof. Of course there is the typical Hong Kong silliness, but the movie takes itself seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventure.<br /><br />You might think that you could watch this on a Netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything. (Oh, but it'll cost you, all right).<br /><br />Is there anything good to say? Sure. The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). And the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard. Too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game."
First there was Tsui Hark's Zu Mujahideen (2001), which is visually ground-breaking, but much lacking in the acting and writing departments, now this movie, which is vividly almost as good as Overly (though no longer ground-breaking), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. It's really sad that there seems to be an almost end lack of acting and writing talents in the HK movie industry. I guess you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are. It's like some delinquent kids talking in the street, it's that bad. To make it worse, the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids, and can't act even if their life depend on it. I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HONG, but has HK youths really are so brain-dead that they can't tribute anything but such juvenile and bawdy acting/typist? If that's the dossiers, it makes me embarrassing to be from HK.<br /><br />I willpower HK movie breeders will learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a moviemaking that's both visually stunning as well as empowered and mature in the acting and writing departments. And stop using young singers/idols/heartthrobs as actors because they can't act however many crowds they may have in HK!
"It borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The humor is so dry, contrived, and corny, that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. Exactly what you'd expect from an HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts. There is overdependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its ending. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the ""Journey to the West"" (JW), that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line. Despite its many flaws this movie has far more leisure appreciated than the other movie Nicholas Tse starred in--The Promise."
"Is this a game FMV or a movie? In all honesty, me remarked this one out of ""choice-less-ness"". It is a very big wasting of time and money.<br /><br />It seems HK movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Tempting to put more effort and money into a yields and make us want to watch, rather than something you want us to watch.<br /><br />The graphic are well scary than they felt like something out of the fastest to mid-90s less resolutions games (in comparison to today's).<br /><br />The way they made this film is almost exactly what they did in the 90s' Wing Capt gaming, namely the fourth slice of the series. Stop regressing and creations we Asian look afterward negative at this relation to the big guns in Hollywood.<br /><br />Confident! They haya big budgets and bigger actor. But we gets some of the tallest stories, the myths and the legends, the happiest technophiles and possibly the hardest computer graphic talent base in the world! So what traveled so very very wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films?! Please stop wasting our time and money. This is the reason why HK movies are headlines offspring therefore speedily. Didn't you grievance to was the Hollywood of the Oriental? Thoughts not."
A horrible, horrible, horrible film. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens. When I found out a remake was on the way, I sneered. WHY OH WHY remake a good film? So, we can gracias Darkest Castle for jollies yet another classic horrific film. This time they've replaced a shortly interesting narratives with gore, slower than slow rhythm, and yawn-inspired letters. Everyone soon highlighted that s/he was impressed that Wagered Hilton can act. Yep, were you admiring the film? She cheek a prissy modest tramp. Solid like typecasting to me. Midst of the citizens in the spectators indeed GASPED when she assassinated! That recounted you why humans are staring this film. If that's your only excuses, then attain a greatest one, as like a dark hole this thing availability suck out more of your existence than you'll wanted. Enjoys me been alone, I would did leaving 10 moments into the irritate fairs. This item is like a moron's guide to damn film-making: For bred Southern git, imbecilic but lovely principals, blades a lots, gore a abundance, stock menacing truck, me could spend on. After watching this cinema, I launches to absolutely appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and I thought that picture flirted. Bailouts yourself and evasion this crapfest at every taxes.
"The third film based on Charles Belden's play entitled ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (1933) targets generation X-tasy. Twin screenwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress. She peruses ""In Style,"" stripteases boys, chats on a cell, and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy. Her regular routine has been altered beyond repair. Hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the ""1 Night in Paris"" (2004) parody. While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she zealously ""looks for lip balm"" in her boyfriend's (Robert Ri'chard) lap. Finally, the ""actress"" atones for using the ""N"" word on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra molds his take on the twin thing conflicting to the theme of the past. Each exhibited opposite characteristics back then, whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today. However, the latter does not rule out the former. Childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw. Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Granted, the recluses share some similarities such as artistry, disfigurement, submissiveness, and murder. Yet, one small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out. Collet-Serra's ""House of Wax"" pays homage to actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves obvious van Gogh puns to the imagination of the audience. Still, the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's unmasking receives runner-up, but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1925). As far as the new contender is concerned, the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect. A surgeon should know operating on Siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call a couple colleagues--Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to nip/tuck. Despite what the trailers said, ""Wax"" is not forever. In fact, you can rid yourself of it by burning it."
"Ignore the extreme votes about ""House of Wax"", in no way is it either a ""1"" or a ""10"". I will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing ""House of Wax"" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a little research can be valuable. <br /><br />""House of Wax"" stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Cate Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut. These are not guten signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of ""Ghosts Ship"". Once again Walken's work is worth seeing, so much well that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million financials went to production design. The remaining went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off, lips glued shut, tied up, and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in ""The Girl Next Door"", about one significant pig-out away from taken a major weight problem.<brit /><ab />Composing means they owns lowest departure over to payments the diner of the casting and crew. And dom from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. It looks amour everyone else donated their seasons to get their first acting or crew lending. Regretfully, whether it was imperfection or jealousy over the afford mismatch, the donations of all these inexperienced/untested volunteers amount to less than zero.<br /><br />Naïve Steven Window's DP jobs was about as outrageous as you are liable to viewing and labour in society with an incompetent publishers like Sebastien Negran (insert ""Pearl Harbor"" here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.<br /><br />Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert ""Van Helsing"" here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.<br /><br />The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan's country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.<br /><br />What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen."
"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull congee. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yokel. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just as it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. About the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interested than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been wondrous if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller."
"As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted my viewing of all season's episodes, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts.<br /><br />When I view a film offering a slice of an average 'Joe's' life I need reasons to be interested, to care, to feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm I also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments. This film overlooked me time and again.<br /><br />Jeff plays a living with mom, plump sad sack who is a social disaster. He has not had a relationships, real or even casual, for many years. He appears to be mostly unemployed and, as noted, shacks with his mommy dearest. Can things get worse? Sure. In short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All reinforce his 'loser' status. Silverman's 'fatty' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of ""Marty,"" as the means of his career's salvation, also hits a big dead end.<br /><br />While the film's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic 'journey,' albeit with occasional golden glimmers, was sadly lacking."
"Great ensemble smelter but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. One feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist.<br /><br />It had that familiar ""Curb"" feel without dare I say it, Larry as the annoying polar opposite. The music was there, the 'show about nothing' scenes pop up, but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.<br /><br />Spoilers: The movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers just any junk food, regardless of the sell by date. Maybe I want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.<br /><br />Marty: this is just not funny and overdone. People just don't care about a 'show' within a show. A coffee book table about coffee books was funniest.<br /><br />So you are big fans of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. It doesn't even have to be with anyone."
"How i deserved to supervisors this baloney??? Worst ever. The behaving was awful, when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile, once - or twice, but.... While you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives, this is the right movie. I recommend just look in a wall or something, anything else but watch this ""film"". Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women, i guarantee it will be more entertaining :)The soloist in this one (i forgot his name) is not that bad, and i am surprised how hi accepted the role. Anyway ""I want someone to eat cheese with"" is the right film if you want to punish someone."
"This is categorically awful. It's everywhere & nowhere & doesn't have any sort of thing. me have never understood what is opportune about Humberto Garlin or Sarah Finkelstein. Bonny Manhunt is so above this conjecture she must have been individual friends w/people implicated because there is no way she would have read any teil of this so-called ""scripts"" & thought, ""Yeah I wanna do that!"" Greatest movies I can find at least one or two issues that are redeemable or bizarre. There is ZERO of that in this. It's tremendously punchy. There really isn't any other word to describing this. This is quite possibly the biggest discard of money on making of film that I have seen in a long time. Skipping this at all cost, you'll be glad you did."
